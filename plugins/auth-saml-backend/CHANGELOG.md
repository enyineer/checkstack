# @checkstack/auth-saml-backend

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 10aa9fb: Add SAML 2.0 SSO support

  - Added new `auth-saml-backend` plugin for SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On authentication
  - Supports SP-initiated SSO with configurable IdP metadata (URL or manual configuration)
  - Uses samlify library for SAML protocol handling
  - Configurable attribute mapping for user email/name extraction
  - Automatic user creation and updates via S2S Identity API
  - Added SAML redirect handling in LoginPage for seamless SSO flow

- d94121b: Add group-to-role mapping for SAML and LDAP authentication

  **Features:**

  - SAML and LDAP users can now be automatically assigned Checkstack roles based on their directory group memberships
  - Configure group mappings in the authentication strategy settings with dynamic role dropdowns
  - Managed role sync: roles configured in mappings are fully synchronized (added when user gains group, removed when user leaves group)
  - Unmanaged roles (manually assigned, not in any mapping) are preserved during sync
  - Optional default role for all users from a directory

  **Bug Fix:**

  - Fixed `x-options-resolver` not working for fields inside arrays with `.default([])` in DynamicForm schemas
