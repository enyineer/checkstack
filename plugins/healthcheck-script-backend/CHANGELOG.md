### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Add environments as a first-class catalog primitive, with per-environment health-check fan-out, config templating, per-environment reactive health, and script run-context exposure.

  - Catalog primitive: an environment is a sibling of groups - a named, instance-global record carrying free-form custom fields (baseUrl, region, tier, ...) that any system can belong to many-to-many. New `environments` + `systems_environments` tables, `EnvironmentSchema` + create/update schemas, `EntityService` environment CRUD and membership joins, RPC endpoints gated by a new `catalogAccess.environment` access rule, a GitOps `Environment` kind + `System.environments` extension, and frontend management (an `EnvironmentEditor`, an Environments management panel, and a per-system environment picker). The Environments card's Add/Edit/Delete affordances are gated on `catalogAccess.environment.manage`.
  - Per-environment fan-out: run identity becomes `(systemId, configurationId, environmentId)`. Runs, aggregates, and state transitions gain a nullable `environmentId`. The health-check assignment gains an `environmentIds` selector with three modes (All / Specific / None; `null` and `[]` are distinct). The queue executor resolves the effective environment set via the catalog `resolveSystemEnvironments` read and executes one isolated run per environment.
  - Config templating: a new `x-templatable` config-field marker renders a string field through the template engine at execute time, against `{ environment, check, system }`. A shared `renderTemplatableConfig` and a `renderTemplatePreview` helper (re-exported from `@checkstack/template-engine`) keep editor previews identical to the run-time render. The HTTP collector's `url`, `headers[].value`, and `body` are templatable, rendered per environment (the strategy client build moves inside the per-env loop); the `url`'s `.url()` validation moves post-render. Secrets resolve before templating; a field marked both secret and `x-templatable` is rejected at plugin load. `DynamicForm` shows a live "Preview" line, and the catalog `EnvironmentPreviewPicker` ("Preview as: <environment>") drives it in the collector editor (only when the schema has a templatable field).
  - Script run-context: `CollectorRunContext` gains an optional `environment` field (`{ id, name, fields }`, metadata only). Shell collectors receive `CHECKSTACK_ENV_ID` / `_NAME` / `CHECKSTACK_ENV_<FIELD>` vars; inline TS collectors read `globalThis.context.environment`; the editor test panel mirrors both. The env-less path is unchanged.
  - Per-environment reactive health (see BREAKING below), env-keyed read/write paths, env-qualified serialization locks, an optional `trigger.payload.environmentId`, per-environment isolation, and an `ENVIRONMENT_RESOLUTION_FAILED` signal when catalog resolution degrades to a single env-less run.

  BREAKING CHANGES: the reactive `health` entity's id-shape and cardinality change. It now encodes two views: per-environment (id `"<systemId>::<environmentId>"`) and a system rollup (id `"<systemId>"`, the worst status across environments + env-less runs). The rollup PRESERVES the pre-existing system-level contract - dashboards, status badges, and automations referencing health by `systemId` keep working without re-authoring - but the entity's contract surface changed (new id-shape, higher cardinality, new payload field), so it is flagged breaking. `getBulkHealthState` parses env-qualified ids and keys results by the original id.

  State and scale: membership and custom fields live only in catalog Postgres and are re-read every tick via the cross-plugin RPC; env-keyed health reads from shared `health_check_runs` / aggregates / transitions (compute-on-read). Every pod resolves the same effective set and the same per-environment health. No pod-local environment state.

  Also: `unwrapSchema` in `zod-config.ts` loops instead of single-pass-stripping so multi-layer wrappers (`.optional().default()`) still resolve `x-templatable` meta. The env-less `{{ environment.* }}` run notice logs at `debug` (a legitimate recurring configuration), while the post-render HTTP `.url()` check still fails a genuinely-broken empty render with a clear "Rendered URL is invalid" error.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Health-check strategy and collector configs now migrate-then-validate when loaded, instead of being cast/rendered raw.

  These configs declared `version: 2`/`3` migrations but the load path never ran them: stored values are persisted UNVERSIONED, and the executor cast them straight to the strategy/collector type. Both the execution path (`queue-executor`) and the read API (`mapConfig`, feeding router / frontend / gitops `getConfiguration`) now use assume-v1-on-read (`Versioned.parseAssumingV1`): wrap as version 1, run the declared chain, then validate. Order is preserved: migrate -> secret resolve -> template render -> execute. An unregistered strategy/collector or a failed migrate falls back to the raw stored blob rather than dropping the configuration. Every reshaper migration is now IDEMPOTENT, guarding on its legacy discriminator so already-current data passes through untouched.

  BREAKING CHANGE: for any config GENUINELY at version 1 in the database (e.g. an HTTP strategy still carrying `url`/`method`, or an execute collector still carrying `command`/`args`), the declared migrations now actually RUN on load, so the loaded/returned shape changes for such rows. This is the intended fix - those fields were already supposed to have been migrated away. Configs already at the current shape are unaffected. No data backfill is performed; migration is applied on every read.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Layered OS-level script sandbox, secure and fail-closed by default (epic #247).

  Script and shell health checks and the `run_shell` / `run_script` automation actions now run inside a layered OS-level sandbox by default. The sandbox lives in `core/backend-api/src/script-sandbox/` (the single source of truth) and is enforced inside the shared runners, so it applies wherever a job runs.

  Layers:

  - Resource caps (CPU / memory / PID / FD / file-size, via `prlimit` on capable Linux; ESM JS-heap cap via `--max-old-space-size`; portable wall-clock timeout) and an OOM-safe streaming output cap.
  - Privilege drop via a NON-ROOT supervisor model: the shipped images run the supervisor as non-root uid `65532`, so every sandboxed script inherits non-root and can never be host-root; filesystem + network confinement is delivered by ROOTLESS `bwrap`/`nsjail` via unprivileged user namespaces. `enforced.privilege` is truthful (true only when the child cannot run as host-root). Runners no longer pass `uid`/`gid` to `Bun.spawn` (a silent no-op and a forward-compat hazard).
  - Filesystem isolation (`scratch-only` / `scratch-plus-ro`) confining the child to its per-run scratch dir over a read-only base; the interpreter path is RO-bound so the runtime execs, and `TMPDIR` is pinned to the in-namespace tmpfs.
  - Network egress control: `deny` (routeless loopback-only netns), `allowlist` (real plumbed egress via macvlan OR rootless slirp4netns + an in-kernel nftables filter), and an always-on metadata / link-local block (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`, `fc00::/7`). No-blackhole invariant: `enforced.network` is never true when egress is actually severed or unfiltered; unpluggable egress degrades to surfaced host net.
  - Per-run fork-bomb containment via RLIMIT*NPROC inside the fresh per-run user+PID namespace; a centralized forbidden-env denylist (`LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD*_`, `NODE*OPTIONS`, `BUN*_`, caller `PATH` overrides).
  - A validated tuned seccomp profile (`deploy/seccomp/checkstack-userns.json`) and a live `clone(CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWNET)` capability probe (not the static sysctl), shipped by default in both Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, and `deploy/k8s/checkstack-sandbox.yaml`.

  Global policy and operator surface:

  - The global sandbox policy lives in ONE durable row owned by `script-packages` (its `ConfigService` row in shared `plugin_configs`). A single process-wide provider serves every runner; the two script plugins no longer register competing providers. A dedicated admin-only `script-sandbox.manage` permission gates both reading and writing the policy. New `getSandboxPolicy` / `setSandboxPolicy` endpoints and a Settings -> Script Sandbox admin UI (`enabled`, `onUnavailable`, network/filesystem/privilege modes, allow list, metadata block, resource caps). The startup capability/readiness log is emitted in-process by `script-packages-backend` (no fragile init-order RPC self-loop), and on a host that cannot enforce a layer a one-time startup warning explains the two local-dev paths (Docker, or set the global policy to `degrade`).
  - Satellite relay: the WS protocol carries the resolved policy in the `authenticated` message and a `sandbox_policy` push-on-change; a satellite caches the last relayed policy and resolves every run through it.

  BREAKING CHANGES (platform in BETA, shipped as minor):

  - Scripts run sandboxed by default. The shipped global default is FAIL-CLOSED (`onUnavailable: "fail"`): when a requested layer cannot be enforced the run is REFUSED (clean `exitCode: -1`, never an unsandboxed spawn) rather than silently degrading. Deployments on hosts that cannot enforce a layer (no bubblewrap, user namespaces blocked, no `/proc` unmask) must run the official images with the documented runtime flags (the bundled seccomp profile + `systempaths=unconfined`, or k8s `procMount: Unmasked`), or set the global policy to `degrade`. On macOS / restricted containers the strong layers degrade to the portable subset and are surfaced per run.
  - Default network posture is deny-egress (`allowlist` with an empty allow list, which resolves to the routeless `deny` path). Scripts calling external endpoints fail until those destinations are allowlisted in the global default. The always-on metadata / link-local block applies even under looser modes.
  - The per-action / per-check `sandbox` config override and the transport `ScriptRequest.sandbox` field are removed; policy is global-only, so an automation/check author can no longer weaken the sandbox on their own item. Stored configs carrying a stray `sandbox` key are tolerated (stripped on parse).
  - The shared runners' `run()` no longer accepts a `sandbox` option; callers rely on the global policy provider.
  - A satellite fails closed (most restrictive profile) until it receives the first relayed policy; a relay-read failure or an older core keeps it fail-closed. A relay failure can never loosen a satellite's sandbox.

  State and scale: the global policy is a single durable Postgres row read identically on every pod. Capability detection is per-process, deterministic from the host kernel, and surfaced per run via the `EffectiveSandbox` report (a Linux pod and a macOS satellite may legitimately differ). `CHECKSTACK_SANDBOX_UID/GID` and macvlan addressing are genuinely per-host infrastructure, surfaced per run, not the queryable policy. The satellite's policy cache is satellite-local transport state. No new pod-local current-state.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Add the auto-generated, version-pinned `@checkstack/sdk` package + codegen, and serve its types live to the in-app editor.

  - A new committed workspace package `@checkstack/sdk`, generated from the platform's source of truth by `scripts/generate-sdk.ts` (`generate:sdk` / `generate:sdk:check`): a fully-typed oRPC client (`createCheckstackClient`) over the REST surface with one `InferClient` per plugin contract, real script-authoring helpers (`@checkstack/sdk/healthcheck`, `@checkstack/sdk/integration`) whose runtime body is the same identity function the in-app runner injects, per-subpath `.d.ts` under the package `exports` map, and an editor-only ambient bundle. A `generate:sdk:check` CI guard fails when the committed SDK files drift from a fresh generation. The `@checkstack/sdk` version is stamped from `@checkstack/release` and MUST NOT appear in a changeset (a guard enforces this); the `@checkstack/release` bump here advances the release version so the generated SDK can be published later. The generated client also normalizes its base URL without a backtracking-prone regex, closing a CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos` finding.
  - Live editor type injection: a new version-keyed route `GET /api/script-packages/sdk-types/:releaseVersion` (raw handler in `@checkstack/script-packages-backend`) serves the generated SDK editor bundle with `Cache-Control: private, max-age=1y, immutable`; the pure path-build/parse module lives in `@checkstack/script-packages-common`, shared by backend and frontend. A mismatched version returns `409` so the editor refetches and never serves stale types after an upgrade. The frontend `useSdkTypeInjection` hook fetches the bundle once per session and mounts it into Monaco via `addExtraLib`. Schema-narrowed `context.config` / `context.event.payload` editor types stay local; the package-resolving module declarations come from the one published `@checkstack/sdk` source.

  BREAKING CHANGES: the script-authoring import surface moves from the bare `@checkstack/healthcheck` / `@checkstack/integration` virtual modules to the `@checkstack/sdk/healthcheck` / `@checkstack/sdk/integration` subpaths of the published `@checkstack/sdk` package. The old bare-name imports no longer resolve (an old import now errors in the editor, surfacing the migration). Existing scripts must update the module specifier:

      - import { defineHealthCheck } from "@checkstack/healthcheck";
      + import { defineHealthCheck } from "@checkstack/sdk/healthcheck";

      - import { defineIntegration } from "@checkstack/integration";
      + import { defineIntegration } from "@checkstack/sdk/integration";

  The helper names and their runtime behaviour are unchanged - only the module specifier moves. The global (no-import) helper form continues to work unchanged.

  This is a beta minor.

### Minor Changes

- 270ef29: Extend in-UI script testing to health-check collectors, and add
  load-from-run replay for automation script tests.

  - Health-check collectors: a new `testCollectorScript` RPC runs the
    inline-script (TypeScript) collector and the shell `script` collector
    against an editable, auto-seeded sample context using the same
    sandboxed runner the real collector uses. Surfaces beneath the
    collector script fields in the collector editor (both marked
    `x-script-testable`). Gated by `healthcheck.configuration.manage`.
  - Automation replay: a new `getRunScopeForReplay` RPC reconstructs an
    editable test context from a real run (trigger + persisted artifacts,
    plus the durable scope snapshot when the run is still in-flight), and
    the script-test panel gains a "Load from run" picker that seeds the
    sample context from a past run.

  Note: health-check executions do not persist the script / config /
  check / system that produced a result, so there is no health-check
  replay - auto-seed is the only context source for collector tests. This
  is by design; see the feature plan.

- 270ef29: Activate npm packages in script execution: thread the managed
  `resolutionRoot` into every user-script call site so an allowlisted package
  can actually be `import`ed.

  - `@checkstack/backend-api`: the ESM runner now always writes a per-run
    `bunfig.toml` with `[install] auto = "disable"` and runs with that dir as
    CWD. Without this Bun silently auto-installs any imported package from the
    registry (verified), defeating the allowlist; with it, imports resolve
    only against the reconciled `current/node_modules` (when a `resolutionRoot`
    is set) and otherwise fail fast.
  - `@checkstack/script-packages-backend`: `resolveResolutionRoot` /
    `resolveResolutionRootFromStore` / `resolveResolutionRootForHost` decide a
    host's resolution-root status (`none` / `ready` / `notReady`) from the
    local `<store>/current`.
  - `run_script` (integration-script-backend), the inline-script collector
    (healthcheck-script-backend, core + satellite), and the in-UI `testScript`
    / `testCollectorScript` endpoints all resolve the root per run and pass it
    to the runner; `run_script` surfaces a clear "npm packages not ready"
    error when configured-but-unsynced. Shell paths are unaffected (no module
    resolution).

  An opt-in end-to-end test (`CHECKSTACK_E2E_NETWORK=1`) proves an allowlisted
  package imports successfully through the real `run_script` action execute
  path, with non-network degradation tests running always.

  BREAKING CHANGES: `@checkstack/backend-api`'s `defaultEsmScriptRunner` now
  always disables Bun auto-install for the user subprocess. A script that
  previously relied on Bun silently fetching an un-vendored package from the
  registry at import time will now fail to resolve it. This is intentional -
  package availability is governed by the admin allowlist - but any caller
  depending on the old implicit auto-install behavior must add the package to
  the allowlist instead. The new `EsmScriptRunOptions.resolutionRoot` field is
  optional and additive (defaults to today's `os.tmpdir()` behavior when
  unset), so the runner API itself is source-compatible.

- 270ef29: Secrets platform Phase 3: just-in-time secret delivery to satellites + source-side masking, and central-execution injection for healthcheck collectors.

  - New satellite WS messages `request_run_secrets` / `run_secrets`: just
    before a satellite runs a collector that declares a `secretEnv`, it asks
    core for that collector's resolved env; core resolves ONLY the secrets the
    collector's OWN persisted assignment declares (least-privilege — the
    satellite cannot choose) and replies with the env map (or a clear error).
    The satellite injects it memory-only for the run and drops it on
    completion. Secrets never ride the persisted assignment and never touch
    disk.
  - Source-side masking: the satellite runs `maskSecrets` over the collector's
    stdout/stderr/result/error using the run's delivered values BEFORE the
    result leaves the satellite (defense in depth).
  - `CollectorStrategy.execute` gains an optional `secretEnv`. The
    inline-script and shell collectors inject it into the runner
    (`process.env` / `$VAR`) and mask the values out of their output.
  - Healthcheck collectors running centrally (the queue executor) also resolve
    - inject `secretEnv` via `secretResolverRef`, closing the gap where a
      centrally-run secretEnv collector got no secrets. A missing required
      secret fails the run clearly in all paths.

### Minor Changes

- 35bc682: feat(healthcheck): expose check + system run-context to script collectors

  Script health checks can now read which check and system a run is for.
  Previously shell scripts got only a curated env whitelist and inline
  scripts only `context.config`, so a script had no built-in way to know
  its own check name or the system it was checking.

  - `@checkstack/backend-api`: new `CollectorRunContext` type
    (`{ check: { id, name, intervalSeconds }, system: { id, name } }`) and
    an optional `runContext` param on `CollectorStrategy.execute`. Optional,
    so existing collector implementations are unaffected.
  - Shell-script collector: injects reserved `CHECKSTACK_CHECK_ID`,
    `CHECKSTACK_CHECK_NAME`, `CHECKSTACK_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
    `CHECKSTACK_SYSTEM_ID`, `CHECKSTACK_SYSTEM_NAME` env vars (user-supplied
    `env` still wins on collision).
  - Inline-script collector: exposes `context.check` and `context.system`
    alongside `context.config`; the inline-script editor now types them for
    autocomplete.
  - Shell editors (health-check collectors and automation shell actions) now
    also suggest the user's own `env` (JSON) keys as `$NAME` completions, via
    the new exported `customShellEnvVars` helper. Keys that aren't valid shell
    identifiers are omitted.
  - Fix: the Typefox `CodeEditor` captured a stale `onChange` at editor start,
    so editing one `DynamicForm` field reverted sibling fields changed since
    mount (e.g. typing in a shell `script` field wiped an unsaved `env` value,
    or deleted a sibling automation action added after mount). The change
    handler now routes through a ref to the current `onChange`.
  - Fix: focusing a JSON editor threw "LanguageStatusService.addStatus is not
    supported" because the standalone service set omitted `ILanguageStatusService`.
    That one service is now registered via `serviceOverrides`.
  - Fix: the automation trigger card nested a `<Badge>` (a `<div>`) inside a
    `<p>`, producing a `validateDOMNesting` warning. Switched the wrapper to a
    `<div>`.
  - Local runs (`queue-executor`) and satellite runs both populate the
    context. `SatelliteAssignment` (and the `getAssignmentsForSatellite`
    RPC output) gained optional `configName` / `systemName` so the metadata
    reaches satellite-side execution; `HealthCheckService` resolves the
    system name via the catalog client.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `createHealthCheckRouter` now requires a `catalogClient`
  option (used to resolve system names for satellite assignments). Update
  call sites to pass the catalog RPC client.

### Minor Changes

- a06b899: Overhaul shell + inline-script health checks with real shell semantics, real ESM execution, and upstream Node/Bun IntelliSense.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - **Shell collector** — the `Execute Script` collector now takes a single `script` string instead of `{ command, args }`. Existing configs are auto-migrated to v2: `command` + `args` are joined with POSIX single-quote escaping into the new `script` field, so behaviour is preserved. Custom UIs that hard-coded `command`/`args` field names need to switch to `script`.
  - **Inline collector** — scripts are now executed as real ES modules in a Bun subprocess (was: `new Function()` inside a Web Worker). The legacy `return X;` style still works (it's auto-wrapped in an async IIFE), but mixed scripts that `import` _and_ `return` at the top level need to use `export default` for their result.

  **FIXES**

  - Shell scripts containing pipes, redirects, `awk`, command substitution, conditionals etc. no longer fail with `ENOENT`. The collector now runs through `sh -c <script>` instead of passing the full expression as `Bun.spawn`'s argv[0]. This was the original `awk … failed with ENOENT` regression.
  - Inline scripts can now `import { loadavg } from "node:os"` (and any other `node:*` or `bun` import). They could not before, because the executor wrapped user code inside `new Function(...)` and ran it in a Web Worker that had no Node module access; the wrapper also made top-level `import` syntactically invalid (`Unexpected token '{'`).
  - Healthcheck editor fields no longer reset while you're editing. The page was re-running its form-state init `useEffect` on every refetch of the configuration query — and that query is invalidated on every realtime `HEALTH_CHECK_RUN_COMPLETED` signal across the platform, so in-progress edits got wiped within seconds. Replaced the naive `useEffect([existingConfig])` with a new `useInitOnceForKey` hook from `@checkstack/ui` that initialises the form only on first load per healthcheck id and ignores background refetches. The hook's decision logic is a pure function (`shouldInitForKey`) and is unit-tested in `useInitOnceForKey.test.ts`.
  - Switching between healthcheck collectors no longer mis-applies the previous collector's tokenizer / language service to the new editor. `MultiTypeEditorField` was reusing the same React instance across collector switches (same `key="script"` in both `DynamicForm` renders) and `selectedType` was initialised from `useState` only once on first mount. After a shell→typescript switch the new collector's TS content rendered through the shell branch (no TS highlighting, no IntelliSense); the reverse direction tokenised shell content through TS and surfaced nonsense errors like `2304 "Cannot find name 'and'"` on shell comments. Now a `useEffect` re-derives `selectedType` whenever `editorTypes` changes to a set that doesn't contain the current selection.
  - Monaco workers are now bundled locally via Vite `?worker` imports and wired up through `MonacoEnvironment.getWorker` in a new `monacoWorkers.ts` module. The default `@monaco-editor/loader` CDN path silently failed CORS on worker scripts in some browsers, leaving Monaco's TS service with only the generic `editorWorkerService` — which is enough for tokenizer-only languages like shell but breaks TypeScript's semantic features entirely. Same module configures the TS service singleton (compiler options, eager-model-sync, diagnostics-options-ignore-1108) at module load instead of inside per-editor `onMount`, so the service starts pre-configured regardless of which language opens first. Migrated from the deprecated `monaco.languages.typescript.*` path to `monaco.typescript.*` (the old path is marked `{ deprecated: true }` in monaco-editor 0.55).
  - `defineIntegration` / `defineHealthCheck` callback parameters are now typed against the schema. Previously the virtual module declared them as `(ctx: unknown) => …`, so writing `defineIntegration(async (context) => { console.log(context.event.eventId) })` produced `'context' is of type 'unknown'. (18046)`. The result type and the shared `IntegrationScriptContext` / `HealthCheckScriptContext` interfaces are now generated together in `scriptContext.ts`, so both the function-arg form and the ambient `declare const context` reference the same schema-typed shape.
  - The shell starter template no longer uses Linux-only `/proc/loadavg` (which fails on macOS satellites with `awk: can't open file /proc/loadavg`). It now reads the 1-minute load average via `uptime` and parses both the Linux (`load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05`) and macOS (`load averages: 0.45 0.55 0.65`) output formats with a portable `sed`/`awk`/`tr` pipeline.
  - Starter-template seeding is now self-healing. `DynamicForm`'s schema-defaults `useEffect` fires AFTER child seed effects in React's child-before-parent order, so the previous one-shot seed got clobbered back to `""` by the defaults call on first mount and never re-fired. Replaced the `[]`-deps effect with a two-effect pattern: an observer that latches `hasSeededRef = true` the first time `value` is observed non-empty, and a seed effect that keeps re-installing the starter while the latch is open. Once the seed sticks the latch closes; subsequent edits and realtime refetches don't re-trigger.

  **NEW**

  - The Monaco editor for inline scripts now mounts the real upstream `@types/node` + `bun-types` declarations as a virtual filesystem (lazy-loaded as its own JS chunk), so IntelliSense covers the full Node/Bun stdlib, the `Bun` global, `process.env`, `Buffer`, etc. DOM types are deliberately excluded so suggestions stay focused on the backend surface. `context.config` is typed from the collector's own JSON Schema.
  - New `healthcheckScriptContext` / `integrationScriptContext` helpers (exported from `@checkstack/ui`) build a complete editor bundle in one call: TS declarations (`context.config` / `context.event.payload` + the virtual `@checkstack/healthcheck` / `@checkstack/integration` result-type modules), starter templates per language, and the shell env-var list (with platform-injected `EVENT_ID` / `DELIVERY_ID` / `PAYLOAD_*` for integrations). Both call sites — `CollectorSection.tsx` and `CreateSubscriptionDialog.tsx` — were rewired to use them, fixing a long-standing wiring gap where IntelliSense for injected values silently never reached the editor.
  - Inline scripts can now `import { defineHealthCheck } from "@checkstack/healthcheck"` (or `defineIntegration` for integrations) for a typed return-shape assertion. The editor catches `{ success: "yes" }` as a type error against `HealthCheckScriptResult`. The runtime is just an identity function — the collector rewrites the import to a sibling helper file in the temp dir before executing.
  - Shell editors now autocomplete env-vars after `$` and `${`. The completion list is supplied by `healthcheckScriptContext` (safe-vars whitelist) and `integrationScriptContext` (whitelist + `EVENT_ID` etc. + `PAYLOAD_*` flattened from the event's payload schema). The matcher is pure and unit-tested in `shellEnvVarMatcher.test.ts` so regex regressions are caught locally.
  - Empty editor fields are now seeded with a working starter template per language (inline TS uses `defineHealthCheck`, inline shell does the `awk` load-average check, integration TS shows `defineIntegration` with `context.event`, integration shell lists the `$EVENT_ID` / `$PAYLOAD_*` env vars). Users see a runnable example instead of a blank canvas; once they edit, we leave their content alone.
  - Hardened concurrency + cleanup model documented and tested: each invocation gets its own `mkdtemp` directory + UUID result marker; the `finally` block clears the timeout handle, kills any surviving subprocess (idempotent), and removes the temp directory on success, throw, _and_ timeout. New `concurrency.test.ts` proves 20 parallel inline scripts don't cross wires and that the temp-dir count returns to baseline after throws and timeouts.

  **TESTING**

  Tight unit tests added so changes to the editor surface don't need smoke testing:

  - `scriptContext.test.ts` — 18 tests covering the generated type declarations (including explicit regression guards for `defineIntegration` / `defineHealthCheck` callback params being typed against the shared context interface rather than `unknown`), starter templates (including a guard that the shell starter doesn't depend on Linux-only `/proc/loadavg`), shell env-vars for both healthcheck + integration flavours, plus the schema-flattening utility.
  - `shellEnvVarMatcher.test.ts` — 12 tests covering the bare `$` / braced `${` / partial-name / case-insensitive matching logic that powers Monaco's shell completion.
  - `inline-script-normaliser.test.ts` — 13 tests covering the legacy `return X;` → IIFE wrap path, the ESM-passthrough path, and the `@checkstack/healthcheck` import rewriter.
  - `inline-script-collector.test.ts` — 18 tests including ones that actually execute a script importing `defineHealthCheck` (named-import form) AND using the global `defineHealthCheck` (no import) to prove both code paths resolve at runtime.
  - `concurrency.test.ts` — 4 tests proving 20 parallel runs don't collide and that the temp-dir count returns to baseline after success, throw, and timeout.
  - `useInitOnceForKey.test.ts` — 10 tests proving the healthcheck-editor form state isn't reset when react-query refetches in the background (the original "fields reset while I'm typing" regression).
  - `starterTemplateSelector.test.ts` — 7 tests for the pure decision function powering empty-field seeding.
  - `security.test.ts` — added an integration test that actually executes the portable load-average pipeline through `Bun.spawn` on the current OS, catching `/proc/loadavg`-style regressions at CI time on macOS runners.

  **SECURITY**

  - Same env-var whitelist as before (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `TZ`, `TMPDIR`, `HOSTNAME`, `SHELL`). Backend secrets in the satellite process's environment remain invisible to user scripts.

  See `docs/src/content/docs/backend/script-healthchecks.md` for the full user-facing guide.

### Patch Changes

- a06b899: Dead-code audit cleanup and a small platform of shared notification helpers.

  **Removed (dead code)**

  - `core/backend/src/plugin-manager/deregistration-guard.ts` deleted. The exported `assertCanDeregister()` was never called and was a less-complete version of the dependents+isUninstallable checks already done inline by `previewUninstallOriginator` / `uninstallOriginator` in `plugin-manager-orchestrator.ts`.
  - `createMockQueueFactory` deprecated alias removed from `@checkstack/test-utils-backend`. Use `createMockQueueManager` directly.

  **New shared helpers**

  - `@checkstack/backend-api` now exports `requestTimeoutMs()` — a Zod field builder for outbound HTTP request timeouts (1s..60s, default 10s). Replaces hand-rolled `configNumber({}).min(1000).max(60_000).default(10_000)` in `integration-webhook-backend`, `integration-script-backend`, and `healthcheck-script-backend`'s inline collector.
  - `@checkstack/notification-common` now exports `SubjectStatusSchema` / `SubjectStatus`, mirroring the existing `ImportanceSchema`.
  - `@checkstack/notification-backend` now exports:
    - `SUBJECT_STATUS_EMOJI` / `IMPORTANCE_EMOJI` — the shared status / importance emoji maps that Discord, Slack, Teams, Webex and Telegram previously each redefined inline.
    - `postJson(opts)` — a timeout-bounded `fetch` wrapper that handles non-2xx logging and error mapping for webhook-style POSTs. Returns `{ ok: true, response } | { ok: false, error }`.

  **Migrated to shared helpers**

  - Discord, Slack, Gotify, Pushover notification backends now use `postJson`. Outer try/catch + per-plugin error mapping deleted (~140 LOC).
  - Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram, Webex notification backends now use `IMPORTANCE_EMOJI`. Discord, Slack, Teams use `SUBJECT_STATUS_EMOJI`.
  - Teams, Webex, Backstage, Telegram kept their inline fetch/Bot logic: their error strings surface server response bodies to operators, or the transport isn't raw `fetch` (Telegram uses `grammy`'s `Bot`).

  **API surface tightening**

  - Per-plugin test-only re-exports in 6 notification backends (Pushover, Gotify, Backstage, Slack, Discord, Teams) and the `CertificateInfo` interface in `healthcheck-tls-backend/strategy.ts` are now JSDoc-tagged `@internal`. No behaviour change; signals that downstream consumers must not depend on them.

- a06b899: Extract shared `EsmScriptRunner` + `ShellScriptRunner` utilities, fix HIGH-severity privilege amplification in the integration TS provider, and harden the integration shell setupGuide example.

  **SECURITY FIX (HIGH)**

  The integration TS provider (`@checkstack/integration-script-backend` → `scriptProvider`) previously executed user scripts via `new Function(script)` in the satellite's main V8 isolate. A user with `integrationAccess.manage` could read `globalThis.process.env` directly (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, queue credentials, signing keys, …) and exfiltrate them through `result.id` — which round-trips into `delivery_logs.externalId` and is readable via the `getDeliveryLog` ORPC procedure. The same permission grants no legitimate API to those secrets; this was a privilege amplification.

  The provider now runs user scripts in a fresh Bun subprocess (matching the healthcheck inline-script collector model). The subprocess receives only a curated `SAFE_ENV_VARS` whitelist (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `TZ`, `TMPDIR`, `HOSTNAME`, `SHELL`) — backend secrets are no longer visible to user code. Filesystem reads, network calls (`fetch`), and the rest of the Node/Bun standard library continue to work, just in an isolated process.

  **BREAKING CHANGE (`@checkstack/integration-script-backend`)**

  User scripts can no longer read the satellite process's environment variables (`process.env.DATABASE_URL` etc. return `undefined`). Scripts that legitimately need configuration should accept it via the provider's `script` field input, not by introspecting the host environment. The full Node/Bun stdlib remains available; only the env scrub is new.

  **REFACTOR — new shared utilities in `@checkstack/backend-api`**

  Both the healthcheck and integration plugins had near-identical inline implementations of "run a user script in a subprocess sandbox" (ESM path) and "run a user shell script through `sh -c`" (shell path). These are now canonical, single-source-of-truth utilities:

  - **`defaultEsmScriptRunner.run({ script, context, timeoutMs, helperModuleName?, helperFunctionName? })`** — writes the user module to a fresh `mkdtemp` directory along with a generated runner module, spawns a Bun subprocess with `pickSafeEnv()`, parses the result back through a UUID-tagged stderr marker, and tears everything down in `finally` (`clearTimeout` + `proc.kill()` + recursive `rm`). The optional `helperModuleName` / `helperFunctionName` pair drops a sibling `_helpers.mjs` file and rewrites `import { <fn> } from "<module>"` to point at it (this is the trick that makes `@checkstack/healthcheck` / `@checkstack/integration` resolve at runtime even though they're not real npm packages).
  - **`defaultShellScriptRunner.run({ script, timeoutMs, cwd?, env? })`** — invokes `sh -c <script>` via `Bun.spawn` with `SAFE_ENV_VARS` (user-supplied `env` merged on top), `Promise.race` timeout with `proc.kill()` on expiry, and the same `clearTimeout` + `proc.kill()` cleanup in `finally`.

  Both runners expose `EsmScriptRunner` / `ShellScriptRunner` interfaces so tests can inject mocks without touching the spawn path. The four call sites (`plugins/healthcheck-script-backend/src/inline-script-collector.ts`, `strategy.ts` and `plugins/integration-script-backend/src/provider.ts`, `shell-provider.ts`) collapse from full inline implementations to ~8-line adapters.

  **FIXES**

  - Integration shell provider's `setupGuide` example replaced the unsafe `curl -d "{\"title\": \"$PAYLOAD_TITLE\"}"` JSON interpolation with a `jq -n --arg title "$PAYLOAD_TITLE" '{title: $title}'` pattern. The previous example demonstrated a shell-injection vulnerability whenever event payload values contained shell-special or JSON-special characters (which they can, since payloads come from other plugins / events / GitOps reconciles).
  - The shared shell runner adds `clearTimeout` + idempotent `proc?.kill()` in `finally`, fixing a leaked event-loop timer in the integration shell provider's previous inline implementation.

  **TESTS**

  - New `core/backend-api/src/esm-script-runner.test.ts` covering `normaliseUserScript` + `rewriteHelperImports` across both healthcheck and integration helper-module names, including regex-metacharacter escape coverage.
  - The plugin-local `inline-script-normaliser.test.ts` was deleted; the same coverage (plus more) lives at the canonical location with the utility.
  - Integration TS provider console-logging tests updated: in the subprocess model, `console.warn` and `console.error` both write to stderr (Bun matches Node), so the provider forwards every stderr line to `logger.error`. `console.log({…})` uses Bun's native `util.inspect` format rather than `JSON.stringify`, so the JSON-logging test now asserts on substring presence instead of strict serialisation.

  2047 tests pass, lint + typecheck clean.

### Patch Changes

- 42abfff: Add practical-significance floors to anomaly detection.

  Two new schema annotations — `x-anomaly-min-absolute-delta` and `x-anomaly-min-relative-delta` — let plugin authors and operators suppress alerts whose statistical deviation is large but practical impact is negligible. Both floors must clear in addition to the existing μ ± Nσ trigger; defaults are 0 (disabled) so existing behaviour is unchanged.

  This is the fix for cases like a 6 ms latency baseline whose σ ≈ 1 ms causes routine 20 ms blips to fire as anomalies despite Δ=14 ms being operationally irrelevant. With `min-absolute-delta: 50` and `min-relative-delta: 0.5`, those blips stay silent while a 6 ms → 200 ms spike still fires.

  Built-in plugins ship with sensible defaults applied to every per-run field: 50 ms + 50 % for ms-unit fields, 5 percentage points for `%`-unit fields, 1 + 25 % for counter fields, 1 GB + 5 % for disk fields, 50 MB + 10 % for memory fields, 1 day for TLS expiry, 0.5 + 25 % for load average, 1 + 5 % for Minecraft TPS. Operators can override per-system or per-field via the assignment UI.

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Patch Changes

- 869b4ab: ## Health Check Execution Improvements

  ### Breaking Changes (backend-api)

  - `HealthCheckStrategy.createClient()` now accepts `unknown` instead of `TConfig` due to TypeScript contravariance constraints. Implementations should use `this.config.validate(config)` to narrow the type.

  ### Features

  - **Platform-level hard timeout**: The executor now wraps the entire health check execution (connection + all collectors) in a single timeout, ensuring checks never hang indefinitely.
  - **Parallel collector execution**: Collectors now run in parallel using `Promise.allSettled()`, improving performance while ensuring all collectors complete regardless of individual failures.
  - **Base strategy config schema**: All strategy configs now extend `baseStrategyConfigSchema` which provides a standardized `timeout` field with sensible defaults (30s, min 100ms).

  ### Fixes

  - Fixed HTTP and Jenkins strategies clearing timeouts before reading the full response body.
  - Simplified registry type signatures by using default type parameters.

- Updated dependencies [869b4ab]
  - @checkstack/backend-api@0.8.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dd1914: Migrate health check strategies to VersionedAggregated with \_type discriminator

  All 13 health check strategies now use `VersionedAggregated` for their `aggregatedResult` property, enabling automatic bucket merging with 100% mathematical fidelity.

  **Key changes:**

  - **`_type` discriminator**: All aggregated state objects now include a required `_type` field (`"average"`, `"rate"`, `"counter"`, `"minmax"`) for reliable type detection
  - The `HealthCheckStrategy` interface now requires `aggregatedResult` to be a `VersionedAggregated<AggregatedResultShape>`
  - Strategy/collector `mergeResult` methods return state objects with `_type` (e.g., `{ _type: "average", _sum, _count, avg }`)
  - `mergeAggregatedBucketResults`, `combineBuckets`, and `reaggregateBuckets` now require `registry` and `strategyId` parameters
  - `HealthCheckService` constructor now requires both `registry` and `collectorRegistry` parameters
  - Frontend `extractComputedValue` now uses `_type` discriminator for robust type detection

  **Breaking Change**: State objects now require `_type`. Merge functions automatically add `_type` to output. The bucket merging functions and `HealthCheckService` now require additional required parameters.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f676e11: Add script execution support and migrate CodeEditor to Monaco

  **Integration providers** (`@checkstack/integration-script-backend`):

  - **Script** - Execute TypeScript/JavaScript with context object
  - **Bash** - Execute shell scripts with environment variables ($EVENT*ID, $PAYLOAD*\*)

  **Health check collectors** (`@checkstack/healthcheck-script-backend`):

  - **InlineScriptCollector** - Run TypeScript directly for health checks
  - **ExecuteCollector** - Bash syntax highlighting for command field

  **CodeEditor migration to Monaco** (`@checkstack/ui`):

  - Replaced CodeMirror with Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor)
  - Full TypeScript/JavaScript IntelliSense with custom type definitions
  - Added `generateTypeDefinitions()` for JSON Schema → TypeScript conversion
  - Removed all CodeMirror dependencies

  **Type updates** (`@checkstack/common`):

  - Added `javascript`, `typescript`, and `bash` to `EditorType` union

### Patch Changes

- 48c2080: Migrate aggregation from batch to incremental (`mergeResult`)

  ### Breaking Changes (Internal)

  - Replaced `aggregateResult(runs[])` with `mergeResult(existing, run)` interface across all HealthCheckStrategy and CollectorStrategy implementations

  ### New Features

  - Added incremental aggregation utilities in `@checkstack/backend-api`:
    - `mergeCounter()` - track occurrences
    - `mergeAverage()` - track sum/count, compute avg
    - `mergeRate()` - track success/total, compute %
    - `mergeMinMax()` - track min/max values
  - Exported Zod schemas for internal state: `averageStateSchema`, `rateStateSchema`, `minMaxStateSchema`, `counterStateSchema`

  ### Improvements

  - Enables O(1) storage overhead by maintaining incremental aggregation state
  - Prepares for real-time hourly aggregation without batch accumulation

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

### Patch Changes

- f533141: Enforce health result factory function usage via branded types

  - Added `healthResultSchema()` builder that enforces the use of factory functions at compile-time
  - Added `healthResultArray()` factory for array fields (e.g., DNS resolved values)
  - Added branded `HealthResultField<T>` type to mark schemas created by factory functions
  - Consolidated `ChartType` and `HealthResultMeta` into `@checkstack/common` as single source of truth
  - Updated all 12 health check strategies and 11 collectors to use `healthResultSchema()`
  - Using raw `z.number()` etc. inside `healthResultSchema()` now causes a TypeScript error
