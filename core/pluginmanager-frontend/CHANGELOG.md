### Minor Changes

- 3547670: Wire the new tips infrastructure across the frontends:

  **Empty-state coaching.** Replace generic "no items" copy with onboarding
  guidance — short description, three numbered steps and a primary CTA — on
  every EmptyState that has a meaningful next action. Affects: catalog
  (systems + groups), dashboard, health-check page, integrations (subscriptions

  - provider connections), GitOps providers + secrets, GitOps provenance,
    SLO config + overview, maintenance config, satellites, plugin manager,
    incident config, announcements. Read-only EmptyStates (incident history,
    maintenance history, plugin events) get clearer descriptions explaining
    what would populate them.

  **First-run anchored tips.** Add `<Tip>` popovers to the most important
  "Create" affordances so first-time users see a one-line explanation of
  what they're about to make and why it matters: catalog “Add System” /
  “Add Group”, healthcheck “Create Check”, integrations “New Subscription”,
  GitOps “Add Provider”, SLO “Create SLO”, maintenance “Create Maintenance”,
  satellite “Create Satellite”, plugin-manager “Install plugin”, incident
  “Report Incident”, announcement “New Announcement”. Each tip is dismissed
  per user (server-backed when signed in, localStorage otherwise) and
  namespaced through `qualifyTipId(plugin, …)` so it cannot escape the
  plugin's own namespace.

  **Welcome banner on the dashboard.** A `<TipBanner>` at the top of the
  dashboard introduces Checkstack's main flow ("add a system, then a health
  check") with a one-click jump into the catalog.

### Patch Changes

- 950d6ec: Fix mobile UserMenu items rendering at zero height, group menu items by
  section, and unstack cramped card headers on small viewports.

  - **UserMenu mobile bug**: On mobile, the user-menu Sheet rendered every
    menu item as a grid row, which combined with `flex-shrink: 1` on each
    item collapsed the buttons whose internal layout uses `display: flex`
    (the items registered with `useNavigate` rather than `<Link>`) to zero
    content height. Switched the mobile container to a flex column with
    `[&>*]:shrink-0` and added `min-h-0` so the sheet scrolls correctly
    when the list overflows.

  - **UserMenu grouping**: Slot extensions now accept an optional `group`
    field. The user menu buckets `UserMenuItemsSlot` extensions by `group`
    and renders each group under a labeled header (`Workspace`,
    `Reliability`, `Configuration`, `Documentation`, `Account`). Existing
    core plugins are tagged with the appropriate group; third-party plugins
    can pick any of these or supply their own label. Untagged extensions
    render last with no header. `UserMenuItemsBottomSlot` is unaffected.

  - **Card header responsiveness**: `CardHeaderRow` (the primitive shared by
    Incident, Maintenance, Auth, Catalog, GitOps and other config cards) now
    stacks vertically on narrow viewports and only switches to a single row
    at the `sm` breakpoint, so titles and adjacent filter controls (e.g.
    status `Select`, "Show resolved" checkbox) no longer cram together on
    mobile. Refactored the Incident and Maintenance config pages to use the
    primitive instead of a hand-rolled `flex items-center justify-between`
    row, and made their `Select` triggers full-width on mobile.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.
