### Minor Changes

- 0b6f01b: feat(ai): add the system.issues aggregator tool and system-signals extension point

  `ai-backend` gains a new read tool, `system.issues`, that returns ALL current
  system issues - failing health checks, breaching or at-risk SLOs, active
  anomalies, open incidents, active maintenances, and dependency problems -
  aggregated across every system in ONE call. The assistant is steered to reach
  for it FIRST whenever asked whether there are issues, what is down, or for an
  overall health overview, instead of polling each per-domain tool. The tool is
  gated by `catalog.system.read`.

  The tool owns no domain knowledge. A new backend `systemSignalsExtensionPoint`
  lets any plugin register ONE `SystemSignalsContributor` from its own `init`; the
  tool fans out across every contributor and merges their per-system maps. Each
  contributor enforces its OWN per-source access gate - returning an empty map
  (never throwing) when the principal lacks access - and reads from shared, durable
  storage so the answer is identical on every pod. `ai-backend` imports no
  capability plugin's `*-common` to collect signals; the dependency direction stays
  plugin -> `@checkstack/ai-backend`.

  The maintenance plugin now registers a `system.issues` contributor (sourceId
  `maintenance`) from its backend `init`, surfacing in-progress maintenances
  alongside the other sources. The contributor enforces its own
  `maintenance.read` gate and reads active maintenances for all systems globally
  via a new `getActiveMaintenancesBySystem` service method. The row->signal mapping
  is extracted into a new pure `deriveMaintenanceSignals` deriver in
  `@checkstack/maintenance-common`, shared by the backend contributor and the
  frontend `MaintenanceSignalsFiller` so the two surfaces stay in lockstep.

  The new `systemSignalsExtensionPoint`, `SystemSignalsContributor`,
  `SystemSignalsExtensionPoint`, and the `system.issues` tool factory plus its
  pure helpers (`mergeSystemSignalsMaps`, `collectSystemSignals`,
  `toSystemIssuesOutput`, schemas) are exported from `@checkstack/ai-backend`.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Plugin-owned AI tools: every domain plugin contributes its own AI tools (chat assistant + automation AI action), and `ai-backend` is platform-only.

  Every plugin-specific AI tool is owned by the plugin whose domain it acts on, registered via that plugin's own `aiToolExtensionPoint` / `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint` from its init - the same path an external plugin author uses. `ai-backend` no longer imports or depends on any capability plugin's `*-common`; the dependency direction is strictly plugin -> ai-platform. Pure helpers (`computeFieldDiff`, capability-summary, `ScriptContextKind`) live in `@checkstack/ai-common`.

  Tools shipped:

  - Health checks and automations: full CRUD - `healthcheck.propose` / `automation.propose` and `*.update` (`mutate`, deep-validated) and `*.delete` (`destructive`, always confirm-gated). `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run calls the new deep `validateConfiguration` so propose-time validation matches apply-time. Assertions are validated against the collector's result schema and the canonical operator vocabulary. Capability-catalog tools (`ai.listCapabilities`, `ai.getCapabilitySchema`), script context tools (`ai.getScriptContext`, `ai.testScript`), and notify-subscriber tools (`healthcheck.notifySystemSubscribers` / `...GroupSubscribers`).
  - Catalog: `catalog.createSystem` / `updateSystem` / `createGroup` / `updateGroup` (`mutate`), `catalog.deleteSystem` / `deleteGroup` (`destructive`), membership tools (`mutate`), plus `catalog.listSystems` / `listGroups` read projections.
  - Incident: `incident.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `resolve` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `incident.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `incident.get` / `incident.list` read projections.
  - Maintenance: `maintenance.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `close` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `maintenance.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `maintenance.list` / `get` read projections.
  - Read projections for SLO (`slo.listObjectives`), dependency (`dependency.list`), incident (`incident.list`), healthcheck (`healthcheck.status`), and anomaly (`anomaly.explain`), each gated by the source procedure's own access rule and routed as the principal.
  - Documentation grounding: `ai.searchDocs` / `ai.getDoc` over a build-time bundled docs index (BM25-ish ranking), so the assistant grounds how-to answers in Checkstack's own docs offline.
  - URL introspection: `ai.probeUrl`, an SSRF-guarded read tool the assistant uses to inspect a real endpoint before drafting a health check. Update tools compute a before -> after field diff rendered on the confirm card (approve mode) or an "Applied" card (auto mode), so a change is never silent.

  `ai_analyze` automation action (automation-backend, with an editor connection picker + audited tool calls): runs a bounded AI agent on the run context as the automation's `runAs` service account, so it can never exceed that identity's permissions; destructive tools are never offered; mutating tools auto-apply through the service account's client. Produces an `automation.analysis` artifact downstream actions can branch on. The agent loop is exposed as a headless `aiAgentRunnerRef` service so automation-backend can drive it without depending on ai-backend.

  `notification.notifyForSubscription` is now callable by user / application principals holding `notification.send` (previously service-only). Every tool routes through the user-scoped client, so handler-side authorization is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC action; the resolver gate plus the propose/apply re-check at propose AND apply are the additional authority. A systemic authz regression test asserts every registered tool falls into exactly one safe authorization category.

  A new `ai_transport` enum value `automation` records the AI action's tool calls in the `ai_tool_calls` audit log. No new durable state beyond that; each tool is a thin, deterministic wrapper over an existing RPC, so every pod behaves identically.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

### Patch Changes

- 9dcc848: Write-path hardening: post-commit side effects can no longer fail a committed write, multi-row mutations are now atomic, and retry-duplication is blocked at the database.

  **Platform-level (automatic for all current and future plugins):**

  - signal-backend: `SignalService` (broadcast / sendToUser / sendToUsers / sendToAuthorizedUsers) is now resilient by construction - a transient event-bus/queue failure is caught and logged instead of thrown. Real-time signals are best-effort UI nudges; the authoritative data is already committed by the time a mutation broadcasts, so a signal-transport blip must never turn a successful write into a client-visible error. Every plugin's broadcasts inherit this without per-call-site `try/catch` (which would inevitably be forgotten and regress). This mirrors `createCachedScope`, which already makes cache invalidation non-throwing - so the cache + signal halves of the "post-commit side effect fails the response" class are both closed at the platform seam. Durable side effects (events/hooks that drive automations, queue jobs) intentionally still surface failures. Documented in `developer-guide/backend/signals.md`.

  **Atomic multi-write mutations (each previously committed row-by-row in autocommit, so a mid-sequence failure left partial/orphaned state):**

  - slo-backend: `createObjective` now inserts the objective and its 1:1 streak row in one transaction; the post-create reconcile/status/notify steps are best-effort and can no longer fail the (committed) create.
  - incident-backend: `createIncident`, `updateIncident`, `addUpdate`, and `resolveIncident` wrap their row + system-link + timeline writes in a transaction (no more wiped system associations on a failed re-insert, or status flips with no matching timeline entry).
  - maintenance-backend: same for `createMaintenance`, `updateMaintenance`, `addUpdate`, `closeMaintenance`.
  - automation-backend: `cancelRun` marks the run cancelled and tears down its wait locks + durable state in one transaction - previously a failure after the status update could leave a wait lock behind, letting a later trigger event resume an already-cancelled run.
  - healthcheck-backend: `ingestSatelliteResult` commits the run row and its hourly-aggregate increment together (no orphaned run, no aggregate without a backing run). NOTE: this guarantees run/aggregate consistency but does not yet make a _duplicate satellite delivery_ idempotent - that needs a dedupe key on the high-volume runs table and is tracked as a follow-up.

  **Retry-duplication blocked at the DB (paired with the SQLSTATE 23505 -> 409 mapping shipped separately):**

  - catalog-backend: new unique indexes on `groups.name`, `environments.name` (consistent with `systems.name`), on `system_links (system_id, url)`, and on `system_contacts (system_id, user_id)` + `(system_id, email)` (NULLs are distinct, so user vs mailbox contacts don't interfere). Name uniqueness is CASE-INSENSITIVE: the three name indexes are functional `lower(name)` indexes (the existing `systems.name` index is rebuilt this way too), so "Api" and "api" collide while the stored value keeps its original casing. The systems pre-write name check (`getSystemByName`) is case-folded to match. Migration `0005` de-dupes any pre-existing rows first - names are preserved by suffixing later case-insensitive duplicates (" (2)", " (3)", ...), redundant contact/link rows are removed keeping the earliest. (Link URLs stay case-sensitive - URL paths are; contact emails are deduped exact-match.)
  - incident-backend / maintenance-backend: unique index on `incident_links (incident_id, url)` / `maintenance_links (maintenance_id, url)`, with a de-dupe step in the migration.

    **Behavior change:** creating a group/environment with a duplicate name, or attaching a duplicate contact/link, now returns `409 Conflict` instead of silently creating a duplicate. The migrations resolve existing duplicates on upgrade.

  This is a beta patch.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 270ef29: Add the health-state provider data contract (automation sensing layer, Wave 2 Phase 13).

  - New `health_check_state_transitions` table records every aggregate health-status transition for a system (all statuses, not just unhealthy), giving a reliable "in current status since" timestamp. Written wherever an aggregate transition is detected. Pruned with raw-run retention, but the single most-recent row per system is always kept so an active streak never blanks.
  - New service-typed RPCs on `HealthCheckApi`: `getHealthState({ systemId, configurationId? })` returns `{ status, inStatusSince, inStatusForMs, latencyMs?, avgLatencyMs?, p95LatencyMs?, successRate?, lastRunAt?, inMaintenance, evaluatedAt }`, and `getBulkHealthState({ systemIds })` (POST) resolves many systems against one shared timestamp.
  - New service-typed RPC on `MaintenanceApi`: `hasActiveMaintenance({ systemId })` reports whether a system is in an active maintenance window regardless of notification-suppression (suppression-agnostic), folded into `getHealthState` as `inMaintenance`.

  All reads are fail-safe: a missing transition row yields `inStatusSince: null`, and a maintenance-plugin error fails open to `inMaintenance: false`.

- b995afb: Make `maintenance` a plugin-backed reactive entity via the Model-B entity state machine.

  Maintenance defines a `maintenance` entity `{ status, systemIds, startAt, endAt }`. The `maintenances` + `maintenance_systems` tables are BOTH authoritative AND the entity's current-state storage - there is no framework `entity_state` mirror. `defineEntity` is given a plugin `read` accessor (`MaintenanceService.getManyEntityStates`, projecting the reactive subset with ISO-serialized timestamps straight off those tables), and every create / update / add-update / close / delete site (plus the automation actions) drives the REAL service write through `handle.mutate` / `handle.remove` via the `writeMaintenanceEntity` / `removeMaintenanceEntity` helpers: `apply` runs the write in the plugin's own transaction and returns the new state; the framework snapshots `prev` via `read` BEFORE the write, appends the transition log, and emits `ENTITY_CHANGED` AFTER the write commits. `MaintenanceService.createMaintenance` accepts an optional pre-generated `id` so a create is keyed on a known id and its `prev` snapshot reads the not-yet-existing row as absent.

  A registered change-deriver maps `maintenance` entity changes back to the `maintenance.created` / `maintenance.updated` trigger events, so existing automations keep firing via the reactive Stage-1/Stage-2 dispatch pipeline. The old `maintenance.created` / `maintenance.updated` change hooks and their hook-backed triggers are removed in favor of the reactive entity.

  BREAKING CHANGES:

  - Removed the `maintenance.created` and `maintenance.updated` hooks (`createHook`) and their re-export from the plugin entry point. Use the `maintenance` entity's auto-emitted change events (subscribe via the `automation.entity` extension point's `onEntityChanged`, or author automations against the derived `maintenance.created` / `maintenance.updated` trigger events).
  - The `created` / `updated` automation triggers are now ENTITY-DRIVEN instead of hook-backed: they are fired by the `maintenance` entity change-deriver (Stage-1 routing) rather than a `createHook`, but stay REGISTERED in the automation editor's trigger catalog (a no-op `setup` via `makeEntityDrivenTriggerSetup`), so they remain offered as picker entries and payload-introspectable. Already-authored automations referencing `maintenance.created` / `maintenance.updated` continue to fire. A registered `toPayload` mapper keeps the runtime `trigger.payload` matching each trigger's declared `payloadSchema` (`maintenanceId`, `status`, `systemIds`, `startAt`, `endAt`). The descriptive fields the old hook carried (`title`, `description`, the `updated`/`closed` `action` discriminator) are NOT part of the reactive entity state, so they are no longer present on the payload.
  - NARROWING: `maintenance.updated` now fires only on a change to the REACTIVE state (`status`, `startAt` / `endAt` window, or affected `systemIds`). A title / description / message-only edit no longer fires `maintenance.updated` (those fields are not reactive entity state). Re-author any automation that needed to react to a metadata-only maintenance edit against a different signal.

### Patch Changes

- b995afb: Extract a shared `withEntityWrite` / `withEntityRemove` guard for PLUGIN-BACKED (Model B) reactive entities and refactor the per-domain copies onto it.

  Every plugin-backed domain (incident, catalog, dependency, maintenance, slo, satellite) reimplemented the same "no handle wired → run the plugin write directly; handle wired → route through `handle.mutate` / `handle.remove`" guard, varying only in the id-key name. `@checkstack/automation-backend` now exports `withEntityWrite` / `withEntityRemove` (from the entity barrel) and each domain's thin, well-named wrappers (`writeIncidentEntity`, `writeMaintenanceEntity`, satellite's `mirror`, …) delegate to it, so the branch lives in exactly one place. Behavior is unchanged.

  `writeHealthEntity` (healthcheck-backend) is intentionally NOT migrated onto the helper — it is genuinely bespoke (closure-captured durable state, distinct rethrow-vs-fail-soft branches, a per-system serializer, and it returns the computed state). SLO keeps its fail-soft `onError` wrapper around the shared guard.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 41c77f4: feat(automation): type enum-able trigger/artifact fields as enums for editor value autocompletion

  The automation editor's staged completion offers concrete values after a
  comparator (`{{ trigger.payload.severity == "high" }}`) only when the
  field's JSON Schema carries an `enum`. Several trigger payload + artifact
  schemas declared closed-set fields as loose `z.string()`, so no values
  were suggested. Tightened them to the canonical enums that already
  existed in each plugin's `-common` package (and matched the hook payload
  types in lockstep so the trigger's `payloadSchema` and `hook` keep the
  same `TPayload`):

  - **incident** — trigger payloads: `severity` → `IncidentSeverityEnum`,
    `status` / `statusChange` → `IncidentStatusEnum`.
  - **healthcheck** — trigger payloads: `previousStatus` / `newStatus` /
    `status` → `HealthCheckStatusSchema` (across systemDegraded,
    systemHealthy, systemHealthChanged, checkFailed; plus checkCompleted's
    hook type).
  - **dependency** — trigger + artifact: `impactType` → `ImpactTypeSchema`;
    impactPropagated `previousState` / `newState` → `DerivedStateSchema`.
    Also deduped the inline `impactTypeSchema` action-config enum to reuse
    the canonical `ImpactTypeSchema`.
  - **maintenance** — trigger + artifact: `status` →
    `MaintenanceStatusEnum`; deduped the inline `maintenanceStatusEnum`
    (used by `add_update.statusChange`) to the canonical one.
  - **slo** — `achievement.unlocked` trigger + hook: `achievement` →
    `AchievementTypeSchema`.

  Runtime behaviour is unchanged — these fields always carried valid enum
  values (the underlying records are enum-constrained); only the schema
  types were loose. The hook payload generics are now precise too, which
  caught one stale test fixture asserting an invalid `impactType: "soft"`.

  Fields that look enum-ish but are genuinely free-form were intentionally
  left as `z.string()`: satellite `region` (user-entered), Jira issue
  `status` (per-instance workflow name), notification `strategyQualifiedId`
  / `errorMessage`, healthcheck collector `result`, and script
  `stdout` / `stderr`.

- 41c77f4: feat(maintenance): Phase 9 — actions + system-shaped helpers

  - Triggers `maintenance.created`, `maintenance.updated` are unchanged;
    they're now lifted out of the inline `register()` block into
    `automations.ts` alongside the new actions.
  - Actions `maintenance.create`, `maintenance.update`,
    `maintenance.add_update` wrapping `MaintenanceService`. Each emits
    the appropriate `maintenanceHooks.*` so downstream automations and
    caches react identically to RPC-driven changes; `add_update`
    re-fetches the window before emitting so the hook payload reflects
    the new status.
  - The two deferred catalog actions land here as
    `maintenance.set_system` (schedule a `now → now+durationMinutes`
    window covering a single system — the "park this system" operation)
    and `maintenance.clear_system` (close every active or scheduled
    window covering a given system — the "let it back into rotation"
    operation).
  - Artifact type `maintenance.window` for downstream steps to consume.

### Patch Changes

- 41c77f4: feat(automation): one-time migration of webhook subscriptions + remove legacy integration backend

  **BREAKING CHANGES** (platform is in BETA — no major bump):

  - `IntegrationProvider` no longer carries `config` (subscription
    config) or `deliver`. The interface now models a connection provider
    only: connection schema + `getConnectionOptions` + `testConnection`.
  - The legacy subscription / delivery-log / event endpoints
    (`listSubscriptions`, `createSubscription`, `getDeliveryLogs`,
    `listEventTypes`, …) are removed from `integrationContract`.
  - `delivery-coordinator`, `hook-subscriber`, `event-registry`, and the
    `integrationEventExtensionPoint` are deleted. Plugins that
    previously called `integrationEvents.registerEvent(...)` now
    register their hooks as automation triggers via
    `automationTriggerExtensionPoint.registerTrigger(...)`.
  - Frontend pages `IntegrationsPage` and `DeliveryLogsPage` are gone;
    the integration plugin's only remaining UI is connection
    management. Subscription management lives under `/automation/...`.
  - `webhook_subscriptions` and `delivery_logs` tables stay in the
    database for one release as a safety net (no code reads or writes
    them), and will be dropped in a follow-up migration.

  **New**:

  - `jira.create_issue`, `teams.post_message`, `webex.post_message`,
    `webhook.send`, `integration-script.run_shell`, and
    `integration-script.run_script` actions registered against the
    Automation Platform with matching `*.message`, `*.delivery`,
    `shell.result`, and `script.result` artifact types. The script
    plugin exposes **two** actions — `run_shell` runs bash via the
    shared `ShellScriptRunner` (Monaco `shell` editor), `run_script`
    runs an ESM module in a Bun subprocess via `EsmScriptRunner`
    (Monaco `typescript` editor + `defineIntegration` helper) — to
    preserve the legacy provider split. `jira.create_issue` keeps the
    dynamic field-mapping dropdown (driven by
    `JIRA_RESOLVERS.FIELD_OPTIONS`).
  - One-time data migration runs on boot in
    `automation-backend.afterPluginsReady`. It reads
    `webhook_subscriptions` via a new service RPC
    `IntegrationApi.listLegacySubscriptions`, translates each row into
    a single-trigger / single-action automation (marked with
    `managed_by = "migrated-subscription:<id>"`), and is idempotent
    across restarts.
  - Failed translations are recorded in a new
    `automation_migration_failures` table and surfaced via
    `AutomationApi.listMigrationFailures` /
    `acknowledgeMigrationFailure` so admins can review and re-create
    failed entries by hand.

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- f23f3c9: Add `correlationMiddleware` to `@checkstack/backend-api` and apply it
  to every plugin/core router so each request carries a stable
  `x-correlation-id` (read from the inbound header, or freshly minted
  via `crypto.randomUUID()` when absent) and an auto-injected child
  logger bound with `{ correlationId, pluginId, userId? }`. The ID is
  echoed back on the response header so the caller can correlate their
  client-side trace to the server logs.

  The `Logger` interface in `@checkstack/backend-api` now formally
  documents the structured-metadata convention (`logger.info("msg",
{ ...meta })`) alongside the long-standing varargs shape. Winston's
  splat handling already routes both shapes through the same vararg
  slot, so existing call sites are unaffected. A new optional
  `Logger.child(meta)` method captures the metadata-binding contract the
  new middleware relies on; production loggers always implement it,
  minimal test mocks may omit it (the middleware falls back gracefully).

  `RpcContext` grew two optional `Headers` bags, `requestHeaders` and
  `responseHeaders`, populated by the outer Hono `/api/*` and `/rest/*`
  handlers in `@checkstack/backend`. They are write-through observation
  points for middleware; an `RpcContext` constructed without them (S2S
  clients, tests) keeps working — the echo is a silent no-op and the ID
  is still bound onto the child logger for server-side correlation.

  The scaffolding template in `@checkstack/scripts` was updated so any
  new plugin generated via `bun run create` wires the middleware in the
  expected `.use(correlationMiddleware).use(autoAuthMiddleware)` order
  out of the box.

### Patch Changes

- b33fb4d: Refresh `bun.lock` to clear MEDIUM-severity Trivy advisories on transitive
  runtime dependencies. No public API change — bumping every workspace
  package that lists `@orpc/server` as a direct dep so consumers re-resolve
  the optional `ws` peer to the patched release on their next install.

  - `ws` `8.20.0` → `8.20.1` (CVE-2026-45736). Pulled into the install tree
    as `@orpc/server`'s optional WebSocket peer; Bun auto-installs it into
    every backend package that depends on `@orpc/server`, so a stale 8.20.0
    ships in the consumer's `node_modules` until the parent package
    re-resolves.
  - `brace-expansion` `5.0.5` → `5.0.6` (CVE-2026-45149). Pulled in only
    through dev tooling (`minimatch@10` via `@typescript-eslint` and
    `storybook`'s `glob@13`), so it does not ship to consumers and no
    workspace `package.json` lists it; the lockfile bump alone clears the
    finding for the Docker image and the local dev tree. No version bump
    is attributed to this advisory.

  The fix lives entirely in `bun.lock` — no `package.json`, `overrides`, or
  `resolutions` change is needed because both parent ranges (`minimatch@10
→ brace-expansion@^5.0.5`, `@orpc/server / storybook / happy-dom →
ws@>=8.18.x`) already accept the patched releases, and `bun install`
  keeps the resolved versions sticky after the initial `bun update`.

### Minor Changes

- 1ef2e79: feat: hotlinks on incidents/maintenances and additional links on systems

  Users with `manage` access on an incident, maintenance, or system can now
  attach free-form URL "hotlinks" — Jira tickets, runbooks, dashboards, ticket
  tools, etc. — alongside the existing fields.

  - **Incidents** & **maintenances**: links live on the entity itself and are
    surfaced both in the editor dialog and on the public detail page. Two new
    RPC procedures per plugin (`addLink`, `removeLink`) gated behind the
    existing `manage` access rule. Links are returned as part of
    `getIncident` / `getMaintenance` and cache-invalidated on every link
    mutation.
  - **Systems**: a parallel `system_links` table with `getSystemLinks`,
    `addSystemLink`, `removeSystemLink` procedures. Surfaced inside the
    system editor (next to contacts) and on the read-only system detail
    sidebar. Cache-scoped per-system so list endpoints remain hot.
  - **Shared UI**: a `LinksEditor` component in `@checkstack/ui` does the
    presentation; the three plugins each own their own RPC wiring.

  Database changes ship as additive migrations (new `incident_links`,
  `maintenance_links`, `system_links` tables, all FK-cascaded on parent
  delete). No existing columns or rows are touched.

  The system incident and maintenance history pages now sort by relevance:
  active entries (non-`resolved` incidents, `scheduled` or `in_progress`
  maintenances) appear at the top, with creation date descending as the
  tiebreaker.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

  ### Anomaly Detection Enhancements (Phase 2)

  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-backend`**: Implemented background baseline analyzer jobs and anomaly trend deviation detection mechanics.
  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-common`**: Added new baseline statistical logic and inference rules.
  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-frontend`**: Added new Anomaly Widget and refactored system detail rendering to be more human-readable.
  - **`@checkstack/dashboard-frontend`**: Refined the global anomaly widget and fixed hardcoded access gating to render appropriately.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`**: Connected executor telemetry to the anomaly pipeline.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`**: Reconciled baseline display consistency in Drawer and charts.

  ### Notification Identifiers

  - **`@checkstack/incident-backend`**: Resolved system IDs to human-readable System Names within Incident notifications to eliminate ID-only alert content.
  - **`@checkstack/maintenance-backend`**: Adopted the same resolution strategy for Maintenance notifications to keep parity.

  ### UI Experience

  - **`@checkstack/incident-frontend`**: Fixed the "Back to X" BackLink to properly use `react-router` hook `useNavigate` instead of doing a full application reload.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`**: Implemented `useNavigate` for seamless SPA back-linking.
  - **`@checkstack/integration-frontend`**: Updated connections and delivery logs links to navigate without hard reloads.

- 8d1ef12: ## Per-entity caching with single-flight + safe invalidation across the dashboard hot paths

  ### `@checkstack/cache-api`

  - **Breaking** for backend implementors: `CacheProvider` now requires `deleteByPrefix(prefix: string): Promise<number>` for family-level invalidation. The in-memory provider implements it; downstream providers (Redis, etc.) must add it before upgrading.
  - `createScopedCache` forwards `deleteByPrefix` and keeps prefixes scoped to the calling plugin.

  ### `@checkstack/cache-utils` (new package)

  High-level read-through caching helpers built on `CacheProvider`:

  - `createCachedScope({ cacheManager, pluginId })` returns a scope with `wrap`, `wrapMany`, `invalidate`, and `invalidatePrefix`.
  - **Single-flight**: concurrent cache misses for the same key share one loader.
  - **Per-entity bulk caching** via `wrapMany` so list/bulk RPCs cache by id rather than by the full input shape — overlapping callers share entries and invalidation stays exact.
  - **Race-safe invalidation** via per-key epoch counters: a loader started before a mutation cannot repopulate the cache with stale data after the mutation invalidates it. The mutation invariant is `db.write → cache.invalidate (await) → signals.emit`.
  - Cache failures fall through to the loader so a cache outage cannot break reads.

  ### `@checkstack/backend`

  - The internal null `CacheProvider` (used when no cache backend is configured) now implements the new `deleteByPrefix` method as a no-op. Patch bump only — no behavior change for existing callers.

  ### `@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`

  - `getSystemHealthStatus` and `getBulkSystemHealthStatus` now read through a per-system cache (`healthcheck:status:<systemId>`), eliminating N database queries per dashboard refresh for unchanged systems.
  - Mutation paths (configuration CRUD, system associations, satellite ingest, queue-driven check runs, system/satellite removal hooks) invalidate affected keys before broadcasting their signals so frontend refetches always observe fresh data.

  ### `@checkstack/incident-backend`

  - `listIncidents`, `getIncident`, `getIncidentsForSystem`, and `getBulkIncidentsForSystems` now read through a scoped cache:
    - per-incident at `incident:<id>`
    - per-system at `system:<systemId>`
    - per-filter-shape at `list:<stable-stringify(filters)>` for the few list shapes the dashboard polls
  - Mutations (`createIncident`, `updateIncident`, `addUpdate`, `resolveIncident`, `deleteIncident`) invalidate the incident, every affected system, and every cached list before broadcasting `INCIDENT_UPDATED`.
  - The catalog `systemDeleted` cleanup hook drops that system's cached entries.

  ### `@checkstack/maintenance-backend`

  - `listMaintenances`, `getMaintenance`, `getMaintenancesForSystem`, and `getBulkMaintenancesForSystems` use the same per-entity / per-system / per-filter-shape pattern as incidents.
  - Mutations (`createMaintenance`, `updateMaintenance`, `addUpdate`, `closeMaintenance`, `deleteMaintenance`) invalidate before broadcasting `MAINTENANCE_UPDATED`.

  ### `@checkstack/catalog-backend`

  - Topology reads (`getEntities`, `getSystems`, `getSystem`, `getGroups`, `getSystemGroupIds`) cache under the `entity:` family (25s TTL).
  - Views (`getViews`) and per-system contacts (`getSystemContacts`) cache in their own families.
  - System / group / membership mutations drop the entire `entity:` family (every reader joins the same tables); view and contact mutations drop only their respective scopes.

  ### `@checkstack/slo-backend`

  - `listObjectives`, `getObjective`, `getObjectivesForSystem`, and `getBulkObjectivesForSystems` cache results including the expensive `engine.computeStatus` output.
  - Per-entity caching for the bulk handler so dashboards with overlapping system sets share entries.
  - Mutations (`createObjective`, `updateObjective`, `deleteObjective`) invalidate before broadcasting `SLO_STATUS_CHANGED`.

  ### `@checkstack/anomaly-backend`

  - New `router-cache.ts` adds a cache scope distinct from the existing detector baseline cache, keyed by stable filter hash.
  - `getAnomalies` and `getAnomalyBaselines` cache through this scope (15s TTL).
  - The detector invalidates the router cache before broadcasting `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED` on every state transition (suspicious/anomaly/recovered).
  - Config mutations also invalidate.

  ### `@checkstack/notification-backend`

  - `getUnreadCount`, `getNotifications`, and `getSubscriptions` cache per-user.
  - `markAsRead`, `deleteNotification`, `notifyUsers`, and `notifyGroups` invalidate every affected user's cache before sending realtime signals to that user.
  - `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` invalidate the user's subscription cache.

  ### `@checkstack/announcement-backend`

  - `getActiveAnnouncements` caches per-user (or anonymous) and per-`includeDismissed` flag (45s TTL — admin-driven, slowly changing).
  - `listAllAnnouncements` caches under a single key.
  - `dismissAnnouncement` only drops that user's cache; `createAnnouncement`, `updateAnnouncement`, `deleteAnnouncement` drop every user's cache before broadcasting `ANNOUNCEMENT_UPDATED`.
  - The auth `userDeleted` cleanup hook drops that user's cached entries.

### Minor Changes

- 298bf42: ### Notification System Optimizations

  **System context in notifications**: All notification senders (healthcheck, incident, maintenance, dependency) now include the affected system name in the notification title and body. Users can immediately identify which system is affected without clicking through to the detail page.

  **Upstream notification deduplication**: When an upstream dependency goes down affecting multiple downstream systems, the dependency notification sidecar now sends **one personalized notification per user** instead of one notification per affected system. Each user's notification lists only the systems they are subscribed to, with a link to the upstream root cause system. This prevents notification floods for users subscribed to groups containing many dependent systems.

  **New catalog endpoint**: Added `getSystemGroupIds` S2S RPC endpoint on the catalog to resolve which catalog groups contain a given system, used by the dependency plugin for efficient subscriber resolution during batched notification dispatch.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 9551fd7: Fix creator display in incident and maintenance status updates

  - Show the creator's profile name instead of UUID in status updates
  - For maintenances, now properly displays the creator name (was missing)
  - For incidents, replaces UUID with human-readable profile name
  - System-generated updates (automatic maintenance transitions) show no creator

- c208a5b: ### @checkstack/incident-backend

  Added notifications for incident status changes via the "Add Update" functionality:

  - Notifications are now sent when an incident is reopened (status changed from resolved)
  - Notifications are now sent when an incident status changes to any new value
  - Notifications are now sent when an incident is resolved via addUpdate
  - Extracted `notifyAffectedSystems` into a reusable module with proper importance logic:
    - Resolved incidents always use "info" importance (good news)
    - Reopened/created/updated incidents derive importance from severity

  ### @checkstack/maintenance-backend

  Fixed missing notification in `closeMaintenance` handler - the "Close" button now sends a "completed" notification to subscribers.

- Updated dependencies [e5079e1]
- Updated dependencies [9551fd7]
  - @checkstack/catalog-common@1.2.6

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c0822d: ### Queue System

  - Added cron pattern support to `scheduleRecurring()` - accepts either `intervalSeconds` or `cronPattern`
  - BullMQ backend uses native cron scheduling via `pattern` option
  - InMemoryQueue implements wall-clock cron scheduling with `cron-parser`

  ### Maintenance Backend

  - Auto status transitions now use cron pattern `* * * * *` for precise second-0 scheduling
  - User notifications are now sent for auto-started and auto-completed maintenances
  - Refactored to call `addUpdate` RPC for status changes, centralizing hook/signal/notification logic

  ### UI

  - DateTimePicker now resets seconds and milliseconds to 0 when time is changed

### Patch Changes

- 66a3963: Update database types to use SafeDatabase

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 65aa47e: Add automatic maintenance status transitions

  Maintenances now automatically transition from `scheduled` to `in_progress` when their `startAt` time is reached, and from `in_progress` to `completed` when their `endAt` time is reached. A recurring queue job runs every minute to check and transition statuses. Integration hooks and real-time signals are emitted upon each transition.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 18fa8e3: Add notification suppression toggle for maintenance windows

  **New Feature:** When creating or editing a maintenance window, you can now enable "Suppress health notifications" to prevent health status change notifications from being sent for affected systems while the maintenance is active (in_progress status). This is useful for planned downtime where health alerts are expected and would otherwise create noise.

  **Changes:**

  - Added `suppressNotifications` field to maintenance schema
  - Added new service-to-service API `hasActiveMaintenanceWithSuppression`
  - Healthcheck queue executor now checks for suppression before sending notifications
  - MaintenanceEditor UI includes new toggle checkbox

  **Bug Fix:** Fixed migration system to correctly set PostgreSQL search_path when running plugin migrations. Previously, migrations could fail with "relation does not exist" errors because the schema context wasn't properly set.

### Patch Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.
