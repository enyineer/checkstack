# @checkstack/anomaly-common

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: ## Anomaly Detection & UI Improvements

  ### Anomaly Detection Enhancements (Phase 2)

  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-backend`**: Implemented background baseline analyzer jobs and anomaly trend deviation detection mechanics.
  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-common`**: Added new baseline statistical logic and inference rules.
  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-frontend`**: Added new Anomaly Widget and refactored system detail rendering to be more human-readable.
  - **`@checkstack/dashboard-frontend`**: Refined the global anomaly widget and fixed hardcoded access gating to render appropriately.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`**: Connected executor telemetry to the anomaly pipeline.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`**: Reconciled baseline display consistency in Drawer and charts.

  ### Notification Identifiers

  - **`@checkstack/incident-backend`**: Resolved system IDs to human-readable System Names within Incident notifications to eliminate ID-only alert content.
  - **`@checkstack/maintenance-backend`**: Adopted the same resolution strategy for Maintenance notifications to keep parity.

  ### UI Experience

  - **`@checkstack/incident-frontend`**: Fixed the "Back to X" BackLink to properly use `react-router` hook `useNavigate` instead of doing a full application reload.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`**: Implemented `useNavigate` for seamless SPA back-linking.
  - **`@checkstack/integration-frontend`**: Updated connections and delivery logs links to navigate without hard reloads.

- 8d1ef12: Phase 2 of anomaly detection: trend drift detection.

  The background baseline analyzer now computes a linear regression slope across each field's chronologically-ordered history and runs a `detectDrift` evaluator that catches gradual "creeping degradation" never reaching the 3σ spike threshold. Drifts share the same `anomalies` table as spike anomalies via a new `kind` column (`spike` | `drift`, default `spike`); the existing suspicious → anomaly → recovered lifecycle is reused, ticking at the analyzer's hourly cadence with a default 2-run confirmation window.

  User-facing additions: a Trend Drift toggle and threshold slider on both the template and assignment anomaly settings panels (with per-field overrides), drift rows in the System Anomaly widget, dashed regression-line overlays on the auto-generated line charts, and a new `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED` signal for live UI updates. Plugin authors can disable drift per chartable field via `x-anomaly-drift-enabled: false` or tighten/loosen it via `x-anomaly-drift-threshold`.

- 8d1ef12: Added Categorical Anomaly Detection (Dominance Drift) support for non-numeric healthcheck values, and introduced Slider UI components for sensitivity and confirmation window anomaly settings.
