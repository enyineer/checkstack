### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: feat(anomaly): per-system and per-field notification mute

  Anomaly notifications now flow through their own subscription group
  (`anomaly.system.<systemId>`) instead of the shared catalog system group, so
  users can opt out of anomaly noise without losing incident or healthcheck
  alerts for the same system. On first deploy, existing subscribers of each
  `catalog.system.<id>` group are seeded onto the new anomaly group so no one
  silently stops getting alerts.

  A new mute table (`anomaly_notification_mutes`) backs two granularities:

  - **Per-field**: silence a single noisy metric on one system.
  - **Per-system**: silence every anomaly for one system in one click.

  The system anomaly widget now exposes a bell icon on each anomaly row plus a
  `Mute all` toggle in the card header. Mutes are user-scoped and persist
  across sessions.

  Catalog gains a `systemCreated` hook so anomaly (and any future plugin) can
  provision per-system state on creation rather than waiting for a restart.
  The notification service gains a `bulkSubscribe` service-RPC used by the
  one-time migration described above.

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: ## Anomaly Detection & UI Improvements

  ### Anomaly Detection Enhancements (Phase 2)

  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-backend`**: Implemented background baseline analyzer jobs and anomaly trend deviation detection mechanics.
  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-common`**: Added new baseline statistical logic and inference rules.
  - **`@checkstack/anomaly-frontend`**: Added new Anomaly Widget and refactored system detail rendering to be more human-readable.
  - **`@checkstack/dashboard-frontend`**: Refined the global anomaly widget and fixed hardcoded access gating to render appropriately.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`**: Connected executor telemetry to the anomaly pipeline.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`**: Reconciled baseline display consistency in Drawer and charts.

  ### Notification Identifiers

  - **`@checkstack/incident-backend`**: Resolved system IDs to human-readable System Names within Incident notifications to eliminate ID-only alert content.
  - **`@checkstack/maintenance-backend`**: Adopted the same resolution strategy for Maintenance notifications to keep parity.

  ### UI Experience

  - **`@checkstack/incident-frontend`**: Fixed the "Back to X" BackLink to properly use `react-router` hook `useNavigate` instead of doing a full application reload.
  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`**: Implemented `useNavigate` for seamless SPA back-linking.
  - **`@checkstack/integration-frontend`**: Updated connections and delivery logs links to navigate without hard reloads.

- 8d1ef12: Phase 2 of anomaly detection: trend drift detection.

  The background baseline analyzer now computes a linear regression slope across each field's chronologically-ordered history and runs a `detectDrift` evaluator that catches gradual "creeping degradation" never reaching the 3σ spike threshold. Drifts share the same `anomalies` table as spike anomalies via a new `kind` column (`spike` | `drift`, default `spike`); the existing suspicious → anomaly → recovered lifecycle is reused, ticking at the analyzer's hourly cadence with a default 2-run confirmation window.

  User-facing additions: a Trend Drift toggle and threshold slider on both the template and assignment anomaly settings panels (with per-field overrides), drift rows in the System Anomaly widget, dashed regression-line overlays on the auto-generated line charts, and a new `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED` signal for live UI updates. Plugin authors can disable drift per chartable field via `x-anomaly-drift-enabled: false` or tighten/loosen it via `x-anomaly-drift-threshold`.

- 8d1ef12: Added Categorical Anomaly Detection (Dominance Drift) support for non-numeric healthcheck values, and introduced Slider UI components for sensitivity and confirmation window anomaly settings.
