### Patch Changes

- 079369a: Fix producing automation actions that double-prefixed their artifact type. The
  action registry qualifies `produces` with the owning plugin id, but several
  actions set `produces` to an already-qualified id, so it became
  `plugin.plugin.type` (e.g. `automation.automation.analysis`,
  `maintenance.maintenance.window`). This stored artifacts under a type that
  matched no registered artifact type, and — because the run scope exposes a
  produced artifact under its type's local name — broke the documented downstream
  reference `artifacts.<actionId>.<name>.<field>` (a `choose`/condition/template
  referencing the analysis output, a created incident/maintenance/etc. silently
  saw `undefined` and took the wrong branch).

  Fixed in `ai_analyze` (`analysis`), the built-in `notify_user`
  (`notify_user_result`), and the catalog (`system_record`), maintenance
  (`window`), notification (`send_result`), dependency (`edge`), and healthcheck
  (`assignment`) actions — each now uses the unqualified local id matching its
  artifact-type definition.

  BREAKING (beta): any automation that referenced one of these artifacts via the
  old double-prefixed scope key (e.g. `artifacts.x['automation.analysis']`) must
  switch to the documented form (`artifacts.x.analysis.<field>`). The
  double-prefixed key was never the intended/documented path.

### Patch Changes

- 56e7c75: Fix frontend access checks to use FULLY-QUALIFIED access-rule ids, and resolve
  the anonymous role on the frontend.

  Granted access-rule ids are stored fully-qualified as `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` (e.g.
  `incident.incident.read`) so two plugins defining the same short rule id never
  collide. The frontend, however, was checking the UNqualified id (`incident.read`)
  via `isAccessRuleSatisfied`, so every check failed for any user without the `*`
  (admin) grant - masked in development because dev-auth grants `*`. This silently
  broke ALL non-admin frontend gating (route guards, sidebar entries, and
  `useAccess`-based button/link gating).

  - **`@checkstack/common`**: `AccessRule` now carries a REQUIRED owning `pluginId`;
    `access()` / `accessPair()` require and stamp it; `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
    qualifies the rule (`{pluginId}.{id}`, plus the manage->read escalation) and
    matches ONLY the qualified form. There is intentionally NO unqualified fallback
    - matching a bare id would let one plugin's grant satisfy another plugin's
      identically-named rule (a cross-plugin privilege-escalation flaw). Every plugin
      that defines access rules now passes its own `pluginId`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend`**: `pluginManager.getAllAccessRules()` no longer strips
    the `pluginId` field (the rule `id` is already fully-qualified for the DB sync).
  - **Route guard** (`@checkstack/frontend` / `@checkstack/frontend-api`) now
    checks the FULL rule object (so it qualifies and escalates), not a bare id.
  - **Anonymous role on the frontend**: the `accessRules` procedure is now
    `public`, returning the configurable anonymous role's grants to unauthenticated
    callers; `useAccessRules` fetches them for guests instead of returning an empty
    set. So anonymous UI now reflects exactly what the anonymous role is allowed -
    which an admin can change (`isPublic` is only the seeded default).
  - Incident / maintenance / SLO detail routes are now read-gated (their read rule
    is an `isPublic` default, so the anonymous role holds it unless an admin
    revokes it); their dashboard status signals carry that rule and render as a
    link only when the viewer may open it.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/common`):** `AccessRule.pluginId` is now REQUIRED, and
  `access()` / `accessPair()` require a `pluginId` option. `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
  matches ONLY the fully-qualified `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` form - the previous
  unqualified fallback is removed, because it was a cross-plugin
  privilege-escalation flaw. Any code constructing an `AccessRule` or calling
  `access()`/`accessPair()` must supply the owning `pluginId`.

  Verified live against an anonymous caller: read pages resolve (qualified match),
  manage actions are denied, manage->read escalation and `*` still work.

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Plugin-owned AI tools: every domain plugin contributes its own AI tools (chat assistant + automation AI action), and `ai-backend` is platform-only.

  Every plugin-specific AI tool is owned by the plugin whose domain it acts on, registered via that plugin's own `aiToolExtensionPoint` / `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint` from its init - the same path an external plugin author uses. `ai-backend` no longer imports or depends on any capability plugin's `*-common`; the dependency direction is strictly plugin -> ai-platform. Pure helpers (`computeFieldDiff`, capability-summary, `ScriptContextKind`) live in `@checkstack/ai-common`.

  Tools shipped:

  - Health checks and automations: full CRUD - `healthcheck.propose` / `automation.propose` and `*.update` (`mutate`, deep-validated) and `*.delete` (`destructive`, always confirm-gated). `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run calls the new deep `validateConfiguration` so propose-time validation matches apply-time. Assertions are validated against the collector's result schema and the canonical operator vocabulary. Capability-catalog tools (`ai.listCapabilities`, `ai.getCapabilitySchema`), script context tools (`ai.getScriptContext`, `ai.testScript`), and notify-subscriber tools (`healthcheck.notifySystemSubscribers` / `...GroupSubscribers`).
  - Catalog: `catalog.createSystem` / `updateSystem` / `createGroup` / `updateGroup` (`mutate`), `catalog.deleteSystem` / `deleteGroup` (`destructive`), membership tools (`mutate`), plus `catalog.listSystems` / `listGroups` read projections.
  - Incident: `incident.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `resolve` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `incident.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `incident.get` / `incident.list` read projections.
  - Maintenance: `maintenance.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `close` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `maintenance.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `maintenance.list` / `get` read projections.
  - Read projections for SLO (`slo.listObjectives`), dependency (`dependency.list`), incident (`incident.list`), healthcheck (`healthcheck.status`), and anomaly (`anomaly.explain`), each gated by the source procedure's own access rule and routed as the principal.
  - Documentation grounding: `ai.searchDocs` / `ai.getDoc` over a build-time bundled docs index (BM25-ish ranking), so the assistant grounds how-to answers in Checkstack's own docs offline.
  - URL introspection: `ai.probeUrl`, an SSRF-guarded read tool the assistant uses to inspect a real endpoint before drafting a health check. Update tools compute a before -> after field diff rendered on the confirm card (approve mode) or an "Applied" card (auto mode), so a change is never silent.

  `ai_analyze` automation action (automation-backend, with an editor connection picker + audited tool calls): runs a bounded AI agent on the run context as the automation's `runAs` service account, so it can never exceed that identity's permissions; destructive tools are never offered; mutating tools auto-apply through the service account's client. Produces an `automation.analysis` artifact downstream actions can branch on. The agent loop is exposed as a headless `aiAgentRunnerRef` service so automation-backend can drive it without depending on ai-backend.

  `notification.notifyForSubscription` is now callable by user / application principals holding `notification.send` (previously service-only). Every tool routes through the user-scoped client, so handler-side authorization is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC action; the resolver gate plus the propose/apply re-check at propose AND apply are the additional authority. A systemic authz regression test asserts every registered tool falls into exactly one safe authorization category.

  A new `ai_transport` enum value `automation` records the AI action's tool calls in the `ai_tool_calls` audit log. No new durable state beyond that; each tool is a thin, deterministic wrapper over an existing RPC, so every pod behaves identically.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Harden config-versioning so stored configs always migrate-then-validate and broken migration chains fail fast at boot.

  - `@checkstack/backend-api` `Versioned<T>` gains `parseAssumingV1` (migrate-from-v1 then validate leniently, runtime path), `parseStrictAssumingV1` (migrate then validate strictly, editor path), and `validateMigrationChainFromV1()`. A standalone pure helper `assertMigrationChainFromV1({ version, migrations })` is the single shared implementation behind the constructor guard and `validateMigrationChainFromV1`.
  - `Versioned` now validates its own v1 -> `version` chain in the constructor, which runs at module import / plugin registration. A new `no-restricted-syntax` ESLint rule bans calling `parse` / `safeParse` / `parseAsync` / `strict` directly on a `Versioned`'s `.schema` member.
  - Auth strategy migration chains are validated at the `betterAuthExtensionPoint.addStrategy` chokepoint (`@checkstack/auth-backend`).
  - Automation action AND trigger configs migrate-then-validate (lenient at dispatch, strict in the editor validator, recursing into `choose`/`parallel`/`repeat`/`sequence` blocks). The `run_script` / `run_shell` action configs bump to `version: 2` dropping the removed `sandbox` key, fixing the editor's `Unrecognized key: sandbox` error.
  - Anomaly read path now validates: `getAnomalyConfig` / `getAnomalyAssignmentConfig` run stored records through `Versioned.parseRecord`; `PartialAnomalySettingsSchema` moved to `@checkstack/anomaly-common`. Notification ConfigService reads thread the migrations argument, and per-strategy `userConfig` is migrate-then-validated before `send()`.
  - gitops-apply migrate-then-validates authored health-check config; integration connection validation routes through `safeValidate`. The latent HTTP health-check `result` schema (at `version: 3` with no migrations) now ships a pass-through v1 -> v2 -> v3 chain.

  BREAKING CHANGES (fail-fast at boot, intended):

  - Any `Versioned` config with `version > 1` and an incomplete or non-contiguous migration chain now throws at construction (boot) instead of failing lazily on first read. This covers every `Versioned` instance repo-wide, including future plugin types. Out-of-tree plugins shipping such a config must add the missing migration step(s); all in-repo strategies already have complete chains.
  - An auth strategy declaring `configVersion > 1` without a complete chain throws at registration.
  - A trigger's per-automation config is now a versioned `config: Versioned<TConfig>` instead of a bare `configSchema?`. Plugins registering triggers with `configSchema:` must wrap it: `config: new Versioned({ version: 1, schema })`. The underlying schema stays reachable via `config.schema`; triggers without per-automation config are unaffected.

  State and scale: all affected reads resolve from shared Postgres / in-process registries, so every pod sees the same migrated answer. No new framework-owned current-state store.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 41c77f4: feat(notification): Phase 9 — delivered/failed triggers + send action

  - New hooks `notificationHooks.delivered` and `notificationHooks.failed`,
    fired from the shared `dispatchWithAttempt` funnel so every external
    delivery path (subscription fan-out + transactional send) surfaces
    uniformly. Persisted attempt rows are unchanged — the hooks are
    best-effort and never block dispatch.
  - Triggers `notification.delivered`, `notification.failed`, both
    carrying `contextKey: (p) => p.notificationId` so an automation can
    resume the run that opened the notification.
  - Action `notification.send` wraps the existing `userType: "service"`
    `sendTransactional` RPC, so automation-driven sends honour the same
    per-user strategy preferences + contact resolution as code-driven
    ones. Returns a `notification.send_result` artifact (per-strategy
    outcome).

  Plumbing note: `createNotificationRouter` now takes a late-bound
  `getDispatchHookSink` getter. `register()` constructs an empty mutable
  container that the router reads on every dispatch; `afterPluginsReady`
  populates it with the real `emitHook`. Until populated (e.g. in
  stripped-down test harnesses) delivery proceeds without firing the
  hooks — no behaviour change for existing callers.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ba07ae2: Quiet down notification spam on flapping systems, auto-open incidents when a check goes critical, and let operators land directly on the broken checks.

  Notification policy lives **per healthcheck assignment** (one row per `system × configuration`). Different checks on the same system are fully independent — disabling a setting on one check does not affect the others. Defaults preserve existing behaviour for `suppressDeEscalations`; **auto-incident defaults to on** for new and existing assignments.

  - **`suppressDeEscalations`** (off by default). When on, transitions from a worse state to a better-but-still-failing state (e.g. `unhealthy → degraded`) no longer fire a notification. Escalations and full recoveries to `healthy` are unaffected. Resolved per assignment (the just-ran check is the one driving any aggregate transition).
  - **`autoOpenIncidentOnUnhealthy`** (on by default). Either of two independent triggers can open the auto-incident:
    - **`sustainedUnhealthyTrigger`** (default 30 min) — opens when the check stays continuously unhealthy for the configured duration. Catches real outages.
    - **`flappingTrigger`** (default 3 transitions in 60 min) — opens when the check flips to unhealthy that many times in the window. Catches persistent flapping where each unhealthy phase is too brief for the sustained trigger.
      Each trigger can be individually disabled. One incident per system: triggering checks attach to an existing active auto-incident.
  - **`useNotificationSuppression`** (on by default, only meaningful when auto-open is on). Controls whether the auto-opened incident is created with `suppressNotifications: true` — leaving this off opens the incident but still pings operators on each transition.
  - **`skipDuringMaintenance`** (on by default). No auto-incident is opened while the system has an active maintenance window with suppression. The system is intentionally down and shouldn't trip the on-call.
  - **`autoCloseAfterMinutes`** (default 30). Auto-close cooldown is now per-assignment and snapshotted per-incident at open time — later policy edits don't alter in-flight incidents. Setting `null` ("Never auto-close") leaves the incident for manual resolution.
  - **Require-recovery rule.** After any auto-incident closes (manual or auto), no new auto-incident can open until the check has logged at least one healthy run. Prevents a "operator dismissed but it's still broken" loop.
  - **Auto-close worker** ticks every 60s and resolves auto-opened incidents whose systems have been healthy for their per-row `cooldownMinutes`. Rows with `null` cooldown are skipped entirely. Per-incident: failed close attempts are logged but never abort the sweep.
  - **`incidentResolved` hook subscriber** syncs the auto-incident mapping when an operator manually resolves the incident, so the require-recovery rule sees the close immediately.
  - **Platform-wide defaults.** New admin RPCs `getPlatformNotificationDefaults` / `setPlatformNotificationDefaults` (under the existing `healthcheck.configuration.{read,manage}` access rules) let operators set notification policy once for the whole instance. Per-assignment rows with `notificationPolicy: null` inherit the platform defaults at read time. UI: a "Notification defaults" button in the Assignment IDE opens a modal editor. The per-assignment Notifications panel shows an inheritance banner — "Using platform defaults" (read-only) with an "Override" button, or "Custom override" with a "Use platform defaults" button to revert. The all-or-nothing model keeps the mental model simple: each assignment is either fully inherited or fully overridden.
  - **New service-level RPCs** on the incident plugin (`createAutoIncident`, `resolveAutoIncident`) let other plugins open/close incidents without a user context. Reused by the healthcheck auto-incident flow.
  - **Health-state notification CTA** now deep-links to `?filter=failing` on the system detail page for non-recovery transitions (label changes to "View failing checks"). The system overview gains an `All / Failing / Healthy` segmented filter wired to the same `?filter=…` param.
  - **Notification bell badge** now counts collapse groups instead of raw rows, so the number matches what the user sees in the notifications list. Built on `COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(collapse_key, id))` — notifications without a collapse key still each count as one.
  - **`statusFilter` on `getHistory` / `getDetailedHistory`** lets the run-history page and the drawer's Recent Runs panel filter to `All / Healthy / Failing` via shared pills, with the page resetting to the first page on filter change.
  - **Pagination defaults aligned with selector options.** Several pages defaulted to a page size (5 or 20) that wasn't in the dropdown's options (`[10, 25, 50, 100]`), so the page-size `<Select>` rendered empty. The drawer's Recent Runs now defaults to 10; the Run History, History List, and Delivery Logs pages now default to 25.

  Includes Drizzle migrations adding the `notification_policy` jsonb column to `system_health_checks`, plus two new tables: `health_check_unhealthy_transitions` (for threshold counting) and `health_check_auto_incidents` (for mapping back to incident ids during auto-close).

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f23f3c9: Add per-channel notification delivery-attempt tracking
  (Phase 8 of the v1 polishing plan). The external dispatch loop now
  persists one row per `strategy.send(...)` call into a new
  `notification_delivery_attempts` table - both successes and
  failures - so silent delivery breakage (misconfigured webhooks, dead
  channels) becomes queryable instead of buried in logs.

  - `@checkstack/notification-backend` adds the
    `notification_delivery_attempts` table, the matching Drizzle
    migration, and a new `dispatchWithAttempt` helper that wraps every
    external `strategy.send(...)` with duration measurement and
    best-effort row persistence. The insert is intentionally
    fire-and-forget: if writing the attempt row itself errors, the
    dispatch loop logs and continues so visibility tracking can never
    introduce a _new_ silent failure.
  - `@checkstack/notification-common` exports a new
    `DeliveryAttemptSchema` zod schema, the
    `ListDeliveryAttemptsInputSchema =
PaginationInput.extend({ notificationId })` input, and a new
    `getDeliveryAttempts` procedure on the contract. The procedure is
    gated by the existing `notificationAccess.admin`
    (`notification:manage`) access rule - no new permission was
    introduced.
  - `@checkstack/notification-frontend` adds a minimal admin-only
    `DeliveryAttemptsPage` (route id `notification.deliveryAttempts`,
    path `/notifications/delivery-attempts`) and an "Open inspector"
    link from the Notification Settings page for users with
    `notification:manage`. No client-side `isAdmin` gate - the FORBIDDEN
    case is rendered via the standard error-state branch on the page,
    enforced by the contract.

  Visibility only: there is no retry mechanism in this phase. A
  `failure` row is a final outcome an admin actions manually
  (re-trigger the source event, fix the misconfigured channel).
  Automated retries are deferred to v1.1.

  Strategy errors thrown during `send(...)` are persisted via
  `extractErrorMessage(error)` so secrets potentially embedded in raw
  error objects (webhook URLs, OAuth tokens reachable from the strategy
  send context) are not stored verbatim.

  See the new
  `docs/src/content/docs/backend/notification-delivery.md` page for the
  full surface description.

### Patch Changes

- f23f3c9: Add `correlationMiddleware` to `@checkstack/backend-api` and apply it
  to every plugin/core router so each request carries a stable
  `x-correlation-id` (read from the inbound header, or freshly minted
  via `crypto.randomUUID()` when absent) and an auto-injected child
  logger bound with `{ correlationId, pluginId, userId? }`. The ID is
  echoed back on the response header so the caller can correlate their
  client-side trace to the server logs.

  The `Logger` interface in `@checkstack/backend-api` now formally
  documents the structured-metadata convention (`logger.info("msg",
{ ...meta })`) alongside the long-standing varargs shape. Winston's
  splat handling already routes both shapes through the same vararg
  slot, so existing call sites are unaffected. A new optional
  `Logger.child(meta)` method captures the metadata-binding contract the
  new middleware relies on; production loggers always implement it,
  minimal test mocks may omit it (the middleware falls back gracefully).

  `RpcContext` grew two optional `Headers` bags, `requestHeaders` and
  `responseHeaders`, populated by the outer Hono `/api/*` and `/rest/*`
  handlers in `@checkstack/backend`. They are write-through observation
  points for middleware; an `RpcContext` constructed without them (S2S
  clients, tests) keeps working — the echo is a silent no-op and the ID
  is still bound onto the child logger for server-side correlation.

  The scaffolding template in `@checkstack/scripts` was updated so any
  new plugin generated via `bun run create` wires the middleware in the
  expected `.use(correlationMiddleware).use(autoAuthMiddleware)` order
  out of the box.

- f23f3c9: Sweep every paginated `*-common` contract onto the canonical
  `PaginationInput` / `PaginatedResult` from `@checkstack/common` and
  remove the now-unused legacy exports.

  **BREAKING CHANGE** - `@checkstack/common` drops the deprecated
  `PaginationInputSchema`, `paginatedOutput`, and `PaginatedResponse`
  symbols. Callers must consume `PaginationInput` (input) and
  `PaginatedResult(itemSchema)` (output) instead. The canonical input is
  `{ limit (1-100, default 20), offset (>= 0, default 0) }`; the
  canonical output envelope is
  `{ items, total, limit, offset }`.

  **BREAKING CHANGE** - `@checkstack/notification-common` migrates
  `getNotifications` off the legacy `PaginationInputSchema`
  (`{ limit, offset, unreadOnly }` with output `{ notifications, total }`)
  onto `ListNotificationsInputSchema =
PaginationInput.extend({ unreadOnly })` and
  `PaginatedResult(NotificationSchema)`. The output key changes from
  `notifications` to `items`, and `limit` / `offset` are now echoed on
  the response. The `PaginationInput` type alias previously exported
  from `notification-common` is removed - use `ListNotificationsInput`
  or the canonical `PaginationInput` from `@checkstack/common`.

  **BREAKING CHANGE** - `@checkstack/integration-common` migrates
  `listSubscriptions` (inline `{ page, pageSize, ... }` -> output
  `{ subscriptions, total }`) and `getDeliveryLogs` (via
  `DeliveryLogQueryInputSchema` `{ subscriptionId?, eventType?, status?,
page, pageSize }` -> output `{ logs, total }`) onto the canonical
  `PaginationInput.extend({...})` input and
  `PaginatedResult(itemSchema)` output. External callers must switch
  from `{ page, pageSize }` to `{ limit, offset }` and read response
  items from `data.items` (no more `data.subscriptions` / `data.logs`).

  The matching `*-backend` handlers were updated to consume the new
  input shape (`offset` arithmetic in lieu of `(page - 1) * pageSize`)
  and to echo `limit` / `offset` on the response. The `*-frontend` call
  sites in `NotificationsPage`, `NotificationBell`, `IntegrationsPage`,
  and `DeliveryLogsPage` were updated to send the new input shape and
  read `data.items`.

- f23f3c9: Phase 9 of the v1 polishing plan: tighten the plugin loader's boot-time
  hook policy and backfill notification-router test coverage.

  `@checkstack/backend` adopts an explicit per-hook policy for the two
  boot-time hooks the plugin loader emits. `pluginInitialized` now
  **halts the boot** if a subscriber throws — a failing subscriber here
  means a downstream never wired itself against the freshly initialised
  plugin, and continuing past that would leave the platform serving
  traffic in a half-wired state. `accessRulesRegistered` keeps its
  log-and-continue behaviour but escalates to `error` level and emits a
  summary count if any subscriber failed; boot-blocking this hook would
  let one misbehaving plugin DOS every other plugin on the same
  instance. The policy is documented inline at each emit site and in a
  new `docs/src/content/docs/backend/plugin-hook-policy.md` page.
  **BREAKING CHANGE**: subscribers to `pluginInitialized` that
  previously threw silently (logged and swallowed) now halt platform
  boot. Audit subscribers and ensure they handle their own internal
  errors before throwing.

  `@checkstack/notification-backend` ships a real
  `core/notification-backend/src/router.test.ts` covering the dispatch
  fan-out (`notifyForSubscription`: zero subscribers, multi-recipient
  insert, `excludeUserIds`, plus NOT_FOUND/FORBIDDEN guard rails), the
  canonical paginated read on `getNotifications` (envelope shape,
  `unreadOnly` filter propagation, null→undefined column mapping), the
  service-only `createGroup` upsert behaviour (happy path + idempotent
  re-create), and the multi-strategy `sendTransactional` path with a
  focused fallback-style assertion: when one strategy throws, the
  dispatch loop continues to the next and surfaces the failure as a
  per-strategy `success: false` row instead of short-circuiting. No
  runtime changes to the notification router.

### Minor Changes

- a06b899: Dead-code audit cleanup and a small platform of shared notification helpers.

  **Removed (dead code)**

  - `core/backend/src/plugin-manager/deregistration-guard.ts` deleted. The exported `assertCanDeregister()` was never called and was a less-complete version of the dependents+isUninstallable checks already done inline by `previewUninstallOriginator` / `uninstallOriginator` in `plugin-manager-orchestrator.ts`.
  - `createMockQueueFactory` deprecated alias removed from `@checkstack/test-utils-backend`. Use `createMockQueueManager` directly.

  **New shared helpers**

  - `@checkstack/backend-api` now exports `requestTimeoutMs()` — a Zod field builder for outbound HTTP request timeouts (1s..60s, default 10s). Replaces hand-rolled `configNumber({}).min(1000).max(60_000).default(10_000)` in `integration-webhook-backend`, `integration-script-backend`, and `healthcheck-script-backend`'s inline collector.
  - `@checkstack/notification-common` now exports `SubjectStatusSchema` / `SubjectStatus`, mirroring the existing `ImportanceSchema`.
  - `@checkstack/notification-backend` now exports:
    - `SUBJECT_STATUS_EMOJI` / `IMPORTANCE_EMOJI` — the shared status / importance emoji maps that Discord, Slack, Teams, Webex and Telegram previously each redefined inline.
    - `postJson(opts)` — a timeout-bounded `fetch` wrapper that handles non-2xx logging and error mapping for webhook-style POSTs. Returns `{ ok: true, response } | { ok: false, error }`.

  **Migrated to shared helpers**

  - Discord, Slack, Gotify, Pushover notification backends now use `postJson`. Outer try/catch + per-plugin error mapping deleted (~140 LOC).
  - Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram, Webex notification backends now use `IMPORTANCE_EMOJI`. Discord, Slack, Teams use `SUBJECT_STATUS_EMOJI`.
  - Teams, Webex, Backstage, Telegram kept their inline fetch/Bot logic: their error strings surface server response bodies to operators, or the transport isn't raw `fetch` (Telegram uses `grammy`'s `Bot`).

  **API surface tightening**

  - Per-plugin test-only re-exports in 6 notification backends (Pushover, Gotify, Backstage, Slack, Discord, Teams) and the `CertificateInfo` interface in `healthcheck-tls-backend/strategy.ts` are now JSDoc-tagged `@internal`. No behaviour change; signals that downstream consumers must not depend on them.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- b33fb4d: Refresh `bun.lock` to clear MEDIUM-severity Trivy advisories on transitive
  runtime dependencies. No public API change — bumping every workspace
  package that lists `@orpc/server` as a direct dep so consumers re-resolve
  the optional `ws` peer to the patched release on their next install.

  - `ws` `8.20.0` → `8.20.1` (CVE-2026-45736). Pulled into the install tree
    as `@orpc/server`'s optional WebSocket peer; Bun auto-installs it into
    every backend package that depends on `@orpc/server`, so a stale 8.20.0
    ships in the consumer's `node_modules` until the parent package
    re-resolves.
  - `brace-expansion` `5.0.5` → `5.0.6` (CVE-2026-45149). Pulled in only
    through dev tooling (`minimatch@10` via `@typescript-eslint` and
    `storybook`'s `glob@13`), so it does not ship to consumers and no
    workspace `package.json` lists it; the lockfile bump alone clears the
    finding for the Docker image and the local dev tree. No version bump
    is attributed to this advisory.

  The fix lives entirely in `bun.lock` — no `package.json`, `overrides`, or
  `resolutions` change is needed because both parent ranges (`minimatch@10
→ brace-expansion@^5.0.5`, `@orpc/server / storybook / happy-dom →
ws@>=8.18.x`) already accept the patched releases, and `bun install`
  keeps the resolved versions sticky after the initial `bun update`.

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: feat(anomaly): per-system and per-field notification mute

  Anomaly notifications now flow through their own subscription group
  (`anomaly.system.<systemId>`) instead of the shared catalog system group, so
  users can opt out of anomaly noise without losing incident or healthcheck
  alerts for the same system. On first deploy, existing subscribers of each
  `catalog.system.<id>` group are seeded onto the new anomaly group so no one
  silently stops getting alerts.

  A new mute table (`anomaly_notification_mutes`) backs two granularities:

  - **Per-field**: silence a single noisy metric on one system.
  - **Per-system**: silence every anomaly for one system in one click.

  The system anomaly widget now exposes a bell icon on each anomaly row plus a
  `Mute all` toggle in the card header. Mutes are user-scoped and persist
  across sessions.

  Catalog gains a `systemCreated` hook so anomaly (and any future plugin) can
  provision per-system state on creation rather than waiting for a restart.
  The notification service gains a `bulkSubscribe` service-RPC used by the
  one-time migration described above.

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

### Patch Changes

- 32d52c6: Fix and improve password reset flow + email branding:

  - **Fix**: password reset emails were failing with "Malformed password reset URL: missing token parameter". Better-auth puts the reset token in the URL path (`/reset-password/{token}`), not as a `?token=` query param, so the previous URL-parsing logic always failed. Now uses the `token` argument better-auth passes to `sendResetPassword` directly.
  - **UX**: the reset password page now validates the token on load via a new anonymous `validateResetToken` endpoint, so users see "Invalid Link" / "Link Expired" before typing a password rather than after submitting. Tokens are 24-char nanoid-style values (~143 bits of entropy), so exposing validity does not enable enumeration.
  - **Fix**: transactional notifications were hardcoded to `importance: "critical"`, causing password reset emails to display a misleading "CRITICAL" badge. The `sendTransactional` contract now accepts an optional `importance` field that defaults to `"info"`.
  - **Branding**: redesigned the email layout (`wrapInEmailLayout`) with a Checkstack-style engineering aesthetic — dark header with grid pattern, monospace importance badge, hardened CTA button (Outlook VML fallback + explicit text color), and force-light color scheme to prevent client auto-inversion from breaking text legibility.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: ## Per-entity caching with single-flight + safe invalidation across the dashboard hot paths

  ### `@checkstack/cache-api`

  - **Breaking** for backend implementors: `CacheProvider` now requires `deleteByPrefix(prefix: string): Promise<number>` for family-level invalidation. The in-memory provider implements it; downstream providers (Redis, etc.) must add it before upgrading.
  - `createScopedCache` forwards `deleteByPrefix` and keeps prefixes scoped to the calling plugin.

  ### `@checkstack/cache-utils` (new package)

  High-level read-through caching helpers built on `CacheProvider`:

  - `createCachedScope({ cacheManager, pluginId })` returns a scope with `wrap`, `wrapMany`, `invalidate`, and `invalidatePrefix`.
  - **Single-flight**: concurrent cache misses for the same key share one loader.
  - **Per-entity bulk caching** via `wrapMany` so list/bulk RPCs cache by id rather than by the full input shape — overlapping callers share entries and invalidation stays exact.
  - **Race-safe invalidation** via per-key epoch counters: a loader started before a mutation cannot repopulate the cache with stale data after the mutation invalidates it. The mutation invariant is `db.write → cache.invalidate (await) → signals.emit`.
  - Cache failures fall through to the loader so a cache outage cannot break reads.

  ### `@checkstack/backend`

  - The internal null `CacheProvider` (used when no cache backend is configured) now implements the new `deleteByPrefix` method as a no-op. Patch bump only — no behavior change for existing callers.

  ### `@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`

  - `getSystemHealthStatus` and `getBulkSystemHealthStatus` now read through a per-system cache (`healthcheck:status:<systemId>`), eliminating N database queries per dashboard refresh for unchanged systems.
  - Mutation paths (configuration CRUD, system associations, satellite ingest, queue-driven check runs, system/satellite removal hooks) invalidate affected keys before broadcasting their signals so frontend refetches always observe fresh data.

  ### `@checkstack/incident-backend`

  - `listIncidents`, `getIncident`, `getIncidentsForSystem`, and `getBulkIncidentsForSystems` now read through a scoped cache:
    - per-incident at `incident:<id>`
    - per-system at `system:<systemId>`
    - per-filter-shape at `list:<stable-stringify(filters)>` for the few list shapes the dashboard polls
  - Mutations (`createIncident`, `updateIncident`, `addUpdate`, `resolveIncident`, `deleteIncident`) invalidate the incident, every affected system, and every cached list before broadcasting `INCIDENT_UPDATED`.
  - The catalog `systemDeleted` cleanup hook drops that system's cached entries.

  ### `@checkstack/maintenance-backend`

  - `listMaintenances`, `getMaintenance`, `getMaintenancesForSystem`, and `getBulkMaintenancesForSystems` use the same per-entity / per-system / per-filter-shape pattern as incidents.
  - Mutations (`createMaintenance`, `updateMaintenance`, `addUpdate`, `closeMaintenance`, `deleteMaintenance`) invalidate before broadcasting `MAINTENANCE_UPDATED`.

  ### `@checkstack/catalog-backend`

  - Topology reads (`getEntities`, `getSystems`, `getSystem`, `getGroups`, `getSystemGroupIds`) cache under the `entity:` family (25s TTL).
  - Views (`getViews`) and per-system contacts (`getSystemContacts`) cache in their own families.
  - System / group / membership mutations drop the entire `entity:` family (every reader joins the same tables); view and contact mutations drop only their respective scopes.

  ### `@checkstack/slo-backend`

  - `listObjectives`, `getObjective`, `getObjectivesForSystem`, and `getBulkObjectivesForSystems` cache results including the expensive `engine.computeStatus` output.
  - Per-entity caching for the bulk handler so dashboards with overlapping system sets share entries.
  - Mutations (`createObjective`, `updateObjective`, `deleteObjective`) invalidate before broadcasting `SLO_STATUS_CHANGED`.

  ### `@checkstack/anomaly-backend`

  - New `router-cache.ts` adds a cache scope distinct from the existing detector baseline cache, keyed by stable filter hash.
  - `getAnomalies` and `getAnomalyBaselines` cache through this scope (15s TTL).
  - The detector invalidates the router cache before broadcasting `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED` on every state transition (suspicious/anomaly/recovered).
  - Config mutations also invalidate.

  ### `@checkstack/notification-backend`

  - `getUnreadCount`, `getNotifications`, and `getSubscriptions` cache per-user.
  - `markAsRead`, `deleteNotification`, `notifyUsers`, and `notifyGroups` invalidate every affected user's cache before sending realtime signals to that user.
  - `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` invalidate the user's subscription cache.

  ### `@checkstack/announcement-backend`

  - `getActiveAnnouncements` caches per-user (or anonymous) and per-`includeDismissed` flag (45s TTL — admin-driven, slowly changing).
  - `listAllAnnouncements` caches under a single key.
  - `dismissAnnouncement` only drops that user's cache; `createAnnouncement`, `updateAnnouncement`, `deleteAnnouncement` drop every user's cache before broadcasting `ANNOUNCEMENT_UPDATED`.
  - The auth `userDeleted` cleanup hook drops that user's cached entries.

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b4eb432: Fixed TypeScript generic contravariance issue in notification strategy registration.

  The `register` and `addStrategy` methods now use generic type parameters instead of `unknown`, allowing notification strategy plugins with typed OAuth configurations to be registered without compiler errors. This fixes contravariance issues where function parameters in `StrategyOAuthConfig<TConfig>` could not be assigned when `TConfig` was a specific type.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b55fae6: Added realtime Signal Service for backend-to-frontend push notifications via WebSockets.

  ## New Packages

  - **@checkstack/signal-common**: Shared types including `Signal`, `SignalService`, `createSignal()`, and WebSocket protocol messages
  - **@checkstack/signal-backend**: `SignalServiceImpl` with EventBus integration and Bun WebSocket handler using native pub/sub
  - **@checkstack/signal-frontend**: React `SignalProvider` and `useSignal()` hook for consuming typed signals

  ## Changes

  - **@checkstack/backend-api**: Added `coreServices.signalService` reference for plugins to emit signals
  - **@checkstack/backend**: Integrated WebSocket server at `/api/signals/ws` with session-based authentication

  ## Usage

  Backend plugins can emit signals:

  ```typescript
  import { coreServices } from "@checkstack/backend-api";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  const signalService = context.signalService;
  await signalService.sendToUser(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, userId, { ... });
  ```

  Frontend components subscribe to signals:

  ```tsx
  import { useSignal } from "@checkstack/signal-frontend";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  useSignal(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, (payload) => {
    // Handle realtime notification
  });
  ```

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.
