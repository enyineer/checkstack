# @checkstack/notification-common

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9016526: Add a `/rest/:pluginId/*` HTTP mount that serves every plugin's oRPC contract
  through the REST/OpenAPI shape described by `/api/openapi.json`. Queries are
  `GET` with query parameters, mutations are `POST` with the input as the raw
  JSON body. The existing `/api/:pluginId/*` mount continues to serve oRPC's
  native wire protocol unchanged, so existing clients are not affected.

  The OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json` now reflects the real mount: every
  `paths` entry is prefixed with `/rest` instead of `/api`.

  Also fixes a SPA-fallback bug: the backend's `/api-docs` route previously
  returned 404 on production deployments because the static-file middleware
  skipped any path starting with `/api`, capturing `/api-docs` along with real
  API routes. The skip now requires a trailing slash (`/api/`, `/rest/`).

  Required access rules are now visible in the API Docs UI. The OpenAPI spec
  generator was reading a non-existent `accessRules` field on procedure
  metadata; the real field is `access: AccessRule[]`. Each procedure's access
  rules are now flattened to fully-qualified IDs (e.g. `catalog.system.read`)
  and emitted under `x-orpc-meta.accessRules`, which the existing
  `Required Access Rules` section in the docs UI already knew how to render.

  The API Docs schema renderer now handles record types (zod `z.record`),
  `$ref`s into `components.schemas`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, nullable union
  types (`type: ["string", "null"]`), and `format` qualifiers. Previously
  record outputs like `{ statuses: object }` masked the actual value type;
  they now render as `{ [key]: <ResolvedType> { ... } }` with the inner
  schema expanded, capped at 12 levels with cycle detection.

  **REST method conventions.** `proc()` now defaults to `GET` for queries and
  `POST` for mutations on the `/rest` mount, using bracket-notation query
  params (`?filter[status]=active&ids[0]=a`) for GET inputs. Existing
  procedures were updated to follow REST semantics:

  - `update*` mutations → `PATCH`
  - `delete*` / `remove*` mutations → `DELETE`
  - `getBulk*` queries and any query taking a large array input → `POST`
    (because `@orpc/openapi@1.13.x` has no GET→POST URL-length fallback)

  GET endpoints require an `object` input — bare scalars like
  `.input(z.string())` are not valid on GET. `getSystemConfigurations` was
  refactored from `.input(z.string())` to `.input(z.object({ systemId: ... }))`
  to fit the GET shape; the only call-site update was the in-process router
  unpacking `input.systemId` instead of passing `input` directly.

  The API Docs UI now renders query parameters (path/query/header/cookie) in a
  dedicated table for GET endpoints, and the fetch example shows them in the
  URL with `<required>` / `<optional>` placeholders.

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: feat(anomaly): per-system and per-field notification mute

  Anomaly notifications now flow through their own subscription group
  (`anomaly.system.<systemId>`) instead of the shared catalog system group, so
  users can opt out of anomaly noise without losing incident or healthcheck
  alerts for the same system. On first deploy, existing subscribers of each
  `catalog.system.<id>` group are seeded onto the new anomaly group so no one
  silently stops getting alerts.

  A new mute table (`anomaly_notification_mutes`) backs two granularities:

  - **Per-field**: silence a single noisy metric on one system.
  - **Per-system**: silence every anomaly for one system in one click.

  The system anomaly widget now exposes a bell icon on each anomaly row plus a
  `Mute all` toggle in the card header. Mutes are user-scoped and persist
  across sessions.

  Catalog gains a `systemCreated` hook so anomaly (and any future plugin) can
  provision per-system state on creation rather than waiting for a restart.
  The notification service gains a `bulkSubscribe` service-RPC used by the
  one-time migration described above.

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

- 32d52c6: feat: unified notification-subscription manager dialog driven by spec registry

  Replaces the bell-toggle UX (which only managed a single legacy
  catalog group) with a modal that lists every notification type
  registered against a target — system or group — and exposes both
  per-type toggles and a bulk "Subscribe to all / Unsubscribe from all"
  action. Both surfaces (system detail page header bell, dashboard group
  header bell) now open the same `NotificationSubscriptionsManager`
  component.

  **Key change vs. the prior slot-based approach**: rows are now driven
  by `notificationClient.listSubscriptionSpecs` — the backend's spec
  registry is the single source of truth. Previously, a row only
  appeared if a frontend plugin had remembered to register a
  `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension`; this caused silent drift
  (healthcheck and dependency registered backend specs without frontend
  extensions, so the dialog counted them but never rendered rows). Now,
  every spec the platform knows about renders a row using the spec's
  `display` metadata (title, description, iconName resolved via
  `DynamicIcon`).

  **Sub-controls registry** (`@checkstack/notification-frontend`):
  plugins that want sub-granularity (anomaly's per-field mute list,
  future severity / channel filters) call
  `registerSubscriptionSubControls(spec, Component)` at module load —
  the manager looks the component up by `specId` when expanding a row.

  **Removed (no compat)**:

  - `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension` (replaced by the
    spec-driven manager + the SubControls registry)
  - `target.slot` field on `NotificationTarget` and the
    `NotificationTargetInput.slot` parameter on
    `defineNotificationTarget`
  - `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot` and
    `GroupNotificationSubscriptionsSlot` from `@checkstack/catalog-common`
  - `SystemNotificationsCard` from the system detail page's main column
  - `SubscribeButton` wiring on dashboard group cards and the system
    detail page header

  **Migrated frontends**: anomaly (now registers `AnomalyFieldMuteList`
  via the SubControls registry), incident, maintenance — all dropped
  their `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension` calls. healthcheck and
  dependency now show up automatically via the spec registry — no
  frontend changes needed for them to render.

  The trigger button reflects aggregate state — filled bell when at
  least one spec is subscribed for the resource, ghost bell when none.

### Patch Changes

- 32d52c6: Fix and improve password reset flow + email branding:

  - **Fix**: password reset emails were failing with "Malformed password reset URL: missing token parameter". Better-auth puts the reset token in the URL path (`/reset-password/{token}`), not as a `?token=` query param, so the previous URL-parsing logic always failed. Now uses the `token` argument better-auth passes to `sendResetPassword` directly.
  - **UX**: the reset password page now validates the token on load via a new anonymous `validateResetToken` endpoint, so users see "Invalid Link" / "Link Expired" before typing a password rather than after submitting. Tokens are 24-char nanoid-style values (~143 bits of entropy), so exposing validity does not enable enumeration.
  - **Fix**: transactional notifications were hardcoded to `importance: "critical"`, causing password reset emails to display a misleading "CRITICAL" badge. The `sendTransactional` contract now accepts an optional `importance` field that defaults to `"info"`.
  - **Branding**: redesigned the email layout (`wrapInEmailLayout`) with a Checkstack-style engineering aesthetic — dark header with grid pattern, monospace importance badge, hardened CTA button (Outlook VML fallback + explicit text color), and force-light color scheme to prevent client auto-inversion from breaking text legibility.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7a23261]
  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

### Minor Changes

- b55fae6: Added realtime Signal Service for backend-to-frontend push notifications via WebSockets.

  ## New Packages

  - **@checkstack/signal-common**: Shared types including `Signal`, `SignalService`, `createSignal()`, and WebSocket protocol messages
  - **@checkstack/signal-backend**: `SignalServiceImpl` with EventBus integration and Bun WebSocket handler using native pub/sub
  - **@checkstack/signal-frontend**: React `SignalProvider` and `useSignal()` hook for consuming typed signals

  ## Changes

  - **@checkstack/backend-api**: Added `coreServices.signalService` reference for plugins to emit signals
  - **@checkstack/backend**: Integrated WebSocket server at `/api/signals/ws` with session-based authentication

  ## Usage

  Backend plugins can emit signals:

  ```typescript
  import { coreServices } from "@checkstack/backend-api";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  const signalService = context.signalService;
  await signalService.sendToUser(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, userId, { ... });
  ```

  Frontend components subscribe to signals:

  ```tsx
  import { useSignal } from "@checkstack/signal-frontend";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  useSignal(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, (payload) => {
    // Handle realtime notification
  });
  ```

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.

### Patch Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- Updated dependencies [ffc28f6]
- Updated dependencies [b55fae6]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.0
