## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b55fae6: Added realtime Signal Service for backend-to-frontend push notifications via WebSockets.

  ## New Packages

  - **@checkstack/signal-common**: Shared types including `Signal`, `SignalService`, `createSignal()`, and WebSocket protocol messages
  - **@checkstack/signal-backend**: `SignalServiceImpl` with EventBus integration and Bun WebSocket handler using native pub/sub
  - **@checkstack/signal-frontend**: React `SignalProvider` and `useSignal()` hook for consuming typed signals

  ## Changes

  - **@checkstack/backend-api**: Added `coreServices.signalService` reference for plugins to emit signals
  - **@checkstack/backend**: Integrated WebSocket server at `/api/signals/ws` with session-based authentication

  ## Usage

  Backend plugins can emit signals:

  ```typescript
  import { coreServices } from "@checkstack/backend-api";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  const signalService = context.signalService;
  await signalService.sendToUser(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, userId, { ... });
  ```

  Frontend components subscribe to signals:

  ```tsx
  import { useSignal } from "@checkstack/signal-frontend";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  useSignal(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, (payload) => {
    // Handle realtime notification
  });
  ```

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.

### Patch Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- Updated dependencies [ffc28f6]
- Updated dependencies [b55fae6]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.0
