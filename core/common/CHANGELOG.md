### Minor Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions
