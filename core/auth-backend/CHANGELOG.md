### Minor Changes

- 0d912a3: Make the frontend fully RLAC-aware so team-scoped users see and can use exactly
  what the backend already authorises - no more, no less. Previously every nav
  entry, route, management page, create button, per-row action, and resource
  picker gated purely on a user's GLOBAL access rule, so a user whose team manages
  a system saw none of the surfaces the backend would happily let them use, and
  (where a page did render) could select systems they don't manage and only fail
  after submit.

  Platform primitives (on `AccessApi`, from `@checkstack/frontend-api`, implemented
  in `@checkstack/auth-frontend`). Each ORs the global RBAC rule with team-derived
  (ReBAC) grants, so a global-rule holder always sees everything:

  - `useCanCreate({ accessRule, objectType, parentType? })` - may the user create
    this type (global rule, a team `creator` grant, or managing a parent resource).
  - `useCanAccessType({ accessRule, objectType, parentType? })` - may the user
    reach a management SURFACE for this type at all (create capability OR managing
    any existing object of the type / its parent). Powers route guards, sidebar
    entries, and a management page's top-level `allowed`.
  - `useResourceAccess({ accessRule, objectType, resourceIds })` - a `canAccess(id)`
    predicate for per-row controls and for filtering resource pickers.

  Backed by three authenticated `auth` RPC procedures - `canCreate`,
  `myManageableTypes`, and `listMyAccessibleResources` - the frontend-facing
  mirrors of the existing S2S authorization endpoints, resolved against the
  caller's own team grants.

  Route/nav gating is now capability-aware: a route may declare
  `manageCapability: { objectType, parentType? }`; the route guard and sidebar then
  show/allow it for team-scoped users via `myManageableTypes`. Applied to the
  catalog, incident, maintenance, SLO, healthcheck, automation, and status-page
  management routes. The route guard resolves this through a single
  `useRouteAccess` hook with a constant hook count, since the guard is reconciled
  in place as the URL changes (a conditional hook there would trip the rules of
  hooks).

  Resource types are now typed, plugin-qualified constants. A new
  `resourceType(pluginMetadata, localType)` factory in `@checkstack/common` mints a
  nominal `ResourceType`, and each `*-common` package exports its constants (e.g.
  `catalogResourceTypes.system`, `incidentResourceTypes.incident`). The capability
  APIs accept `ResourceType`, so a mistyped `"catalog.system"` string now fails
  typecheck instead of silently breaking a gate.

  Resource pickers now offer only what the backend will accept:

  - Incident and maintenance "Affected Systems" pickers show only systems the user
    manages (or all with the global rule), matching the backend's requirement of
    MANAGE on every referenced system.
  - SLO creation is now system-scoped end to end: `createObjective` gains a
    `catalog.system` parent gate (managing the target system authorises creating an
    SLO for it, like incident/maintenance), and the SLO editor's system picker is
    filtered to manageable systems.
  - Catalog group and environment membership (add-to-group / add-to-environment,
    per-row and bulk) is gated on managing the system being (re)assigned.
  - The health-check assignment surface (Assignment IDE + the system-detail
    "Health Checks" action) requires MANAGE on the target system.

  Catalog membership chips only render a removable "x" for systems the user
  manages (removing a group/environment membership requires managing the system),
  and the Dependency Map only lets a user originate an edge from a system they
  manage (the source is access-checked; the target is not).

  Owning-team correctness: a parent-gated creator (team member, no global rule)
  who left the owning team unset previously created an object with no team grant -
  which they then could not edit. The `authorizeCreate` parent-gate path now
  resolves an owning team instead of silently orphaning the object (auto-assigns
  when the caller belongs to exactly one team, requires an explicit choice when
  several), and the `TeamOwnershipPicker` marks the field required and
  auto-selects the sole eligible team.

  Dependency writes are fixed to authorize on the SOURCE system. `createDependency`
  / `updateDependency` / `deleteDependency` previously used `instanceAccess:
{ idParam: "systemId" }`, which made the middleware look for a `dependency` grant
  keyed by the system id - a grant that never exists - so every team-scoped source
  manager was denied ("Access denied to resource dependency:<systemId>"). They now
  `parentScope` on `catalog.system` manage, so managing the source system
  authorises editing its dependencies (the target is not access-checked), matching
  health-check assignment.

  The backend authorization changes are limited to: the new read-only capability
  procedures (`canCreate` / `myManageableTypes` / `listMyAccessibleResources`), the
  SLO create parent gate, the `authorizeCreate` owning-team resolution, and the
  dependency source-scope fix. Everything else only aligns the UI with
  authorization the backend already enforced.

### Patch Changes

- 0d912a3: Let platform admins configure roles they belong to. The self-role guard (you
  cannot edit or delete the access rules of a role you currently have) exists to
  prevent access elevation, but a wildcard (`*`) admin already holds every access
  rule, so there is nothing to elevate - and the guard locked them out of
  configuring roles they were automatically added to. `updateRole` and
  `deleteRole` now exempt wildcard admins, and the role editor no longer disables
  the access-rule checkboxes (or shows the self-lockout notice) for them. The
  admin role itself stays non-editable (its access is the wildcard), and system
  roles remain undeletable.

### Minor Changes

- 8cad340: Periodically prune expired `better_auth_rate_limit` rows.

  better-auth's shared-Postgres brute-force limiter only ever upserts counters, so the `better_auth_rate_limit` table grew one row per distinct `(ip, path)` key forever and nothing ever removed dead rows. auth-backend now schedules an hourly recurring queue job (cron `0 * * * *`, work-queue consumer group) that runs an idempotent `DELETE` of rows whose `lastRequest` is older than a conservative 24h TTL - far past any active limiter window, so a live counter is never removed. The sweep is exposed as `pruneExpiredBetterAuthRateLimits` for reuse and testing. No schema change (pruning is a DELETE). Pod-safe: a single consumer per fire runs the sweep, and the DELETE is shared-DB so duplicate fires are harmless.

- 8cad340: fix(security): crypto + auth depth hardening (at-rest encryption, brute-force scale, token timing)

  Three concrete defects found and fixed during the deferred crypto + auth depth audit:

  - **At-rest encryption (`@checkstack/backend-api`)**: AES-256-GCM decrypt now
    rejects values whose IV is not exactly 12 bytes or whose auth tag is not the
    full 16 bytes (128-bit). GCM accepts truncated tags, which weaken forgery
    resistance; the encryptor only ever emits full tags, so short tags now hard-
    error instead of being silently accepted. `isEncrypted` is also tightened to
    require the exact decoded IV/tag lengths, not just a loose
    `base64:base64:base64` shape, so a plaintext secret that merely resembles the
    shape can no longer be misclassified as "already encrypted" and stored in
    plaintext. The unique-nonce and tamper-rejection guarantees are now covered by
    regression tests.

  - **Brute-force protection scale bug (`@checkstack/auth-backend`)**: better-auth's
    built-in rate limiter (sign-in, password reset) defaulted to per-pod in-memory
    storage. With N replicas behind one database that multiplied the effective
    limit by N (state-and-scale §14.5). The limiter is now backed by a shared
    `better_auth_rate_limit` Postgres table via a `customStorage` adapter, so the
    counter is global across all pods. Adds a new append-only migration for the
    table. No behaviour change in local dev (limiter stays off when not in
    production); no configuration required.

  - **Satellite token timing oracle (`@checkstack/satellite-backend`)**:
    `validateToken` previously skipped the bcrypt verify when the `clientId` did
    not exist, leaking client-ID existence via response timing. It now always
    verifies the supplied token (against a decoy hash when the row is missing) so
    the missing-clientId path costs the same as the wrong-token path.

  Audited and found clean (no change needed): the better-auth cookie/session/CSRF
  posture (`httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax`, `Secure` derived from the https `BASE_URL`,
  single trusted origin, fresh session on internal trusted-login), and
  token/secret logging hygiene across the auth, satellite, and secrets paths (no
  secret material is logged).

### Patch Changes

- 8cad340: fix(auth-backend): close first-run onboarding TOCTOU race

  `completeOnboarding` (the anonymous first-run mutation that creates the first
  admin) now takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock and re-checks "no users
  exist" INSIDE the transaction. Previously the existence check ran in a separate
  statement before the insert transaction, so two concurrent first-run calls with
  different emails could both pass the guard and both create an admin user during
  the brief unbootstrapped window. The lock serializes onboarding attempts so the
  second caller observes the first caller's committed admin and is rejected.

### Minor Changes

- d2077bd: Platform-wide team-scoped access control on a unified relation-tuple store.

  Admins can scope any resource to teams, and the **platform** (not each plugin)
  enforces it. A plugin opts in declaratively by adding `instanceAccess` to a
  procedure's contract; the auth middleware does the rest, so enforcement is
  consistent across catalog, health checks, incidents, maintenances, SLOs,
  automations, and the dependency map, and any third-party plugin gets it for free.

  Core model:

  - **Teams are optional.** A resource with no team grants behaves exactly as
    before.
  - **Team grants are additive and restrict who can CHANGE a resource, not who can
    SEE it.** Granting a team `Manage` lets its members view and change the
    resource; `Read-only` lets them view it. Either level grants access to team
    members **even when they lack the global permission**, and granting never
    removes read from anyone who already had it (e.g. a public status page stays
    readable). Privacy is a separate, explicit opt-in via the **Private** toggle,
    which removes the global read path so only the resource's teams can see it.
  - **Ownership at creation.** Create forms expose an **Owning team** picker. A
    non-admin can create a resource for a team they belong to that holds a
    create-capability grant for that type; the new resource is auto-granted to that
    team. Incidents and maintenances are **parent-gated**: anyone who can manage a
    system may open incidents/maintenances for it, no separate grant needed.
  - **Meaningful authorization errors.** A caller with neither the global rule nor
    any team grant for a resource type gets a `403` with a structured body instead
    of a silently-empty `200`. Anonymous callers on public endpoints are never
    `403`'d, so status pages keep rendering.

  Unified relation-tuple store:

  - The previously separate access primitives (`resource_team_access.canRead` /
    `.canManage`, ownership, `resource_access_settings.teamOnly`, and
    `resource_create_grant`) are collapsed onto ONE
    `relation_tuple(object, relation, subject)` store: "a team has
    `viewer`/`editor`/`owner` on an object, or `creator` on a type". Privacy is an
    explicit **`private` marker** tuple — its **presence** closes the global read
    path (team grants only), its **absence** is the readable-by-default state, so a
    private resource with zero grants is correctly inaccessible to everyone rather
    than silently globalized. The access decision is a pure, unit-tested function.
  - The auth API is generic: `writeRelation` / `removeRelation` / `setObjectPublic`
    / `listObjectRelations` / `listSubjectRelations` / `setCreateGrant` /
    `listTeamCreateGrants` (user-facing) and `check` / `listAccessibleObjectIds` /
    `hasAnyTypeGrant` / `authorizeCreate` / `setOwner` / `deleteObjectRelations`
    (service-to-service). Migration `0008` backfills tuples from the legacy tables
    and drops them.

  Explicit per-procedure scoping:

  - Access rules (`access()` / `accessPair()`) define only the rule (id, level,
    defaults); every procedure declares its own `instanceAccess`. This removes a
    "loaded gun" default that silently applied a shared `idParam` to any procedure
    which forgot its own override.
  - Modes: `idParam` (single-resource pre-check, fails **closed** if the id does
    not resolve), `listKey` / `recordKey` (post-filter a list/record to the
    accessible subset), `create` (authorize creation + write the owning-team
    grant), `parentScope` (scope by read/manage access to a PARENT type,
    cross-plugin single-hop: "you may see incidents/maintenances/SLOs/health for
    system S iff you may see S"), and `global: true` (the honest "intentionally not
    team-scoped" opt-out). A boot-time validator **rejects** any procedure gated on
    a team-scopable resource type that declares no `instanceAccess`, turning the
    previous fail-open into a boot error.

  Teams administration:

  - **Team managers** manage their own team's members and managers without the
    global `auth.teams.manage` rule; creating, deleting, and granting a team access
    remain admin-only.
  - A **standalone Teams page** (gated on `auth.teams.read`) lets managers reach
    team administration without the admin Auth Settings page; members are added via
    a debounced directory picker.
  - A **cross-plugin `ResourceResolverRegistry`** lets owning plugins register a
    name/search resolver for their resource types, so the Teams page lists a team's
    grants **by name** (grouped by type) and offers a resource picker — an admin can
    change a grant's level, revoke it, or add one, without auth depending on every
    plugin. Resolvers shipped for catalog systems, health-check configurations,
    incidents, maintenances, SLO objectives, and automations.

  Frontend:

  - The resource-side editor is **"Who can change this"** (one Manage checkbox per
    team; unticked = read-only), with an always-visible **Private** toggle
    (disabled until a team that can Manage exists, so a resource can't be stranded).
  - `TeamOwnershipPicker` explains _why_ there's nothing to pick (not a member of
    any team, or none of your teams manage the selected parent) instead of a bare
    "global resource" line.
  - Read-only **"who can change this"** indicators on resource detail pages expand
    to the actual people by name; bulk + per-row **Scope to team** actions in the
    catalog systems list; and the team-access copy spells out that grants are
    additive and that Read-only grants view (not change) even without the global
    permission.

  Security hardening:

  - Child deletes in catalog (`removeSystemContact` / `removeSystemLink`) are scoped
    to both the child id and its parent `systemId`, closing a cross-system IDOR for
    team-scoped managers.
  - `searchUsers` is restricted to team administrators, closing a directory/email
    enumeration path opened by the default `auth.teams.read` rule.
  - Grant setters reject unregistered resource types.

  BREAKING CHANGES (beta; shipped as minor bumps):

  - `access()` and `accessPair()` no longer accept `idParam` / `listKey` /
    `recordKey`; move instance config to the procedure's `instanceAccess`.
  - Boot fails if a procedure gated on a team-scopable resource type omits
    `instanceAccess`. Declare a scoping mode or `instanceAccess: { global: true }`.
  - The `AuthService` interface is reshaped: `check`, `listAccessibleObjectIds`,
    `hasAnyTypeGrant`, `authorizeCreate` (returns `isPrivate`), `setOwner`
    (`isPrivate`), and `deleteObjectRelations`. Custom `AuthService` implementations
    and mocks must update.
  - The auth RPC contract's per-concept resource-access endpoints are replaced by
    the generic tuple API above; external callers of the old
    `getResourceTeamAccess` / `setResourceTeamAccess` / `setResourceAccessSettings`
    / `grantResourceCreate` / etc. must move to the new procedures.
  - Several contract inputs changed from a bare `string` to an object so the
    middleware can resolve the resource id: catalog `deleteSystem` (`{ id }`),
    `removeSystemContact` / `removeSystemLink` (`{ id, systemId }`); health-check
    `deleteConfiguration` / `pauseConfiguration` / `resumeConfiguration` (`{ id }`).
    All in-tree callers are updated.
  - List/record endpoints that relied on returning an empty `200` to signal "no
    access" now return a `403` for categorically-unauthorized principals.
  - The mis-keyed bulk endpoints `getBulkIncidentsForSystems`,
    `getBulkMaintenancesForSystems`, and `getBulkObjectivesForSystems` no longer
    post-filter their (systemId-keyed) result; access is already gated by
    `catalog.system` upstream.
  - Team membership/manager mutations (`addUserToTeam`, `removeUserFromTeam`,
    `addTeamManager`, `removeTeamManager`) now require `auth.teams.read` instead of
    `auth.teams.manage` at the contract level (broadened to per-team managers).
  - The `resource_team_access`, `resource_access_settings`, and
    `resource_create_grant` tables are dropped (data backfilled into
    `relation_tuple` by migration `0008`). A previously inconsistent "team-only with
    zero grants" resource is now correctly inaccessible to global-access holders.

### Minor Changes

- ebef442: feat(automation): gate integration actions on the runAs service account's permissions

  **BREAKING.** Integration automation actions resolve credentials through a
  trusted service rather than the bounded `runAs` client, so they previously
  bypassed the runAs least-privilege model entirely: anyone able to author an
  automation could create Jira tickets, send Teams/Webex messages, etc. on any
  configured connection, with a zero-permission service account. This closes that
  gap.

  - **Actions declare `requiredAccessRules`** and the dispatch engine enforces
    them against the resolved `runAs` principal BEFORE the action runs (failing
    the step if missing) - the authorization point integration actions lacked.
  - **Each integration plugin defines per-action access rules**, e.g.
    `integration-jira.create_issue.manage` / `search_issues.read` /
    `transition_issue.manage` / `add_comment.manage`,
    `integration-teams.post_message.manage`,
    `integration-webex.post_message.manage`.
  - **`automation.propose` checks the same up front**, surfacing a per-action
    missing-permission error on the review card; `listActions` now exposes each
    action's `requiredAccessRules`, and `getBindableApplications` now returns each
    app's effective `accessRules`.
  - **New `integration.read` rule** gates `listConnectionSummaries` /
    `resolveConnectionOptions` (previously open to any authenticated user), so
    discovering connections and resolving their field options requires a grant.
  - **The AI assistant picks a capable runAs up front.**
    `automation.listServiceAccounts` now returns each account's `accessRules` and
    `automation.getCapabilitySchema` returns each action's `requiredAccessRules`,
    so the model selects a service account whose permissions cover the actions it
    uses instead of proposing and being rejected. When the operator did not name a
    runAs and more than one account qualifies, it ASKS which to use rather than
    choosing the automation's identity itself; when none has the needed rules it
    says which rule(s) to grant.

  **Migration:** existing automations whose service account does not hold the new
  rules will fail at the gated action until an admin grants the matching rule(s)
  to the service account's role (e.g. add `integration-jira.create_issue.manage`).
  Admin (`*`) service accounts are unaffected. Grant `integration.read` to roles
  that author integration-using automations so the editor's connection pickers and
  dropdowns keep working for non-admins.

### Patch Changes

- 0626782: Guard the role editor against granting inert (and misleading) permissions to the
  anonymous role.

  RPC procedures carry two independent axes: `userType` (the hard authentication
  gate) and `access` rules (authorization). An admin can grant the anonymous role
  any access rule, but if the procedures needing that rule are `userType:
"authenticated"`/`"user"`, the grant does nothing - the auth middleware rejects
  unauthenticated callers BEFORE access rules are checked (so there is no security
  hole; the grant is simply inert). After anonymous users started seeing
  permission-gated UI, such a grant would surface as visible-but-broken controls.

  - The backend now computes, from contract metadata, the access rules an anonymous
    caller can actually use (a rule is "usable" iff at least one `public` procedure
    requires it) via `pluginManager.getAnonymousUsableAccessRuleIds()`, exposed to
    plugins through the plugin environment.
  - `auth.getAccessRules` annotates each rule with `anonymousUsable`.
  - `auth.updateRole` REFUSES to ADD a non-usable rule to the anonymous role
    (existing grants are untouched, so no configuration can be wedged). This is a
    guardrail, not an enforcement change - RPC authorization is unchanged.
  - The role editor disables non-usable rules (with an explanation) when editing
    the anonymous role.

  Verified live: `getAccessRules` reports 11 anonymous-usable vs 58 not; granting
  `incident.incident.manage` to the anonymous role returns HTTP 400 with a clear
  message.

- 56e7c75: Fix frontend access checks to use FULLY-QUALIFIED access-rule ids, and resolve
  the anonymous role on the frontend.

  Granted access-rule ids are stored fully-qualified as `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` (e.g.
  `incident.incident.read`) so two plugins defining the same short rule id never
  collide. The frontend, however, was checking the UNqualified id (`incident.read`)
  via `isAccessRuleSatisfied`, so every check failed for any user without the `*`
  (admin) grant - masked in development because dev-auth grants `*`. This silently
  broke ALL non-admin frontend gating (route guards, sidebar entries, and
  `useAccess`-based button/link gating).

  - **`@checkstack/common`**: `AccessRule` now carries a REQUIRED owning `pluginId`;
    `access()` / `accessPair()` require and stamp it; `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
    qualifies the rule (`{pluginId}.{id}`, plus the manage->read escalation) and
    matches ONLY the qualified form. There is intentionally NO unqualified fallback
    - matching a bare id would let one plugin's grant satisfy another plugin's
      identically-named rule (a cross-plugin privilege-escalation flaw). Every plugin
      that defines access rules now passes its own `pluginId`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend`**: `pluginManager.getAllAccessRules()` no longer strips
    the `pluginId` field (the rule `id` is already fully-qualified for the DB sync).
  - **Route guard** (`@checkstack/frontend` / `@checkstack/frontend-api`) now
    checks the FULL rule object (so it qualifies and escalates), not a bare id.
  - **Anonymous role on the frontend**: the `accessRules` procedure is now
    `public`, returning the configurable anonymous role's grants to unauthenticated
    callers; `useAccessRules` fetches them for guests instead of returning an empty
    set. So anonymous UI now reflects exactly what the anonymous role is allowed -
    which an admin can change (`isPublic` is only the seeded default).
  - Incident / maintenance / SLO detail routes are now read-gated (their read rule
    is an `isPublic` default, so the anonymous role holds it unless an admin
    revokes it); their dashboard status signals carry that rule and render as a
    link only when the viewer may open it.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/common`):** `AccessRule.pluginId` is now REQUIRED, and
  `access()` / `accessPair()` require a `pluginId` option. `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
  matches ONLY the fully-qualified `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` form - the previous
  unqualified fallback is removed, because it was a cross-plugin
  privilege-escalation flaw. Any code constructing an `AccessRule` or calling
  `access()`/`accessPair()` must supply the owning `pluginId`.

  Verified live against an anonymous caller: read pages resolve (qualified match),
  manage actions are denied, manage->read escalation and `*` still work.

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Add the AI platform: a transport-agnostic tool spine, an OAuth Authorization Server + read-only MCP server, a propose/apply flow with audit log, a streaming in-app chat agent, per-conversation permission modes, per-integration spend caps, and user-scoped tool authorization.

  Two new packages, `@checkstack/ai-common` (the `AiTool` contract, `read`/`mutate`/`destructive` effect classification, the `ai.*` access rules, the OpenAI-compatible connection shape, and the wire contracts) and `@checkstack/ai-backend` (the tool registry, extension points, principal-to-tool resolver, shared zod-to-JSON-Schema serializer, and all transports). The OpenAI-compatible integration provider registers through the existing integration provider extension point, so its API key is stored in the Secrets Vault and configured in the generic Connections UI.

  What ships:

  - Tool spine and extension points: `aiToolExtensionPoint.registerTool` (hand-authored composite tools) and `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint.expose` (opt-in projections of existing oRPC procedures). Authorization mirrors `autoAuthMiddleware` exactly - a tool is surfaced only when every `requiredAccessRules` entry is satisfied, so a scope-narrowed principal can only ever see fewer tools.
  - OAuth + MCP: Checkstack can act as its own OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server (authorization code + PKCE, consent screen, Dynamic Client Registration) and expose a read-only MCP server over Streamable HTTP at `/api/ai/mcp`. Off by default, enabled by the admin `ai.mcp-oauth` setting. A Bearer OAuth-token branch is added to the auth strategy; token scopes are intersected live with the bound user's access rules on every call. A shared-Postgres rate limiter throttles the DCR endpoint per client IP. `getMcpOAuthSettings` / `setMcpOAuthSettings` contracts added to `@checkstack/auth-common`. A minimal OAuth consent page (`/auth/oauth-consent`) renders the requesting client and scopes.
  - Propose/apply + audit: a transport-agnostic two-step service - `propose` re-checks authz, runs the tool's `dryRun` without mutating, and returns a single-use proposal token (the `proposed` audit row IS the token store, 10-minute TTL, atomic single-use); `apply` re-parses the server-stored payload, re-checks authz, and atomically commits. The `ai_tool_calls` audit table records every call across both transports with a SHA-256 args hash (never raw arguments) and stamps who proposed and who applied. An `ai.toolCalled` event carries metadata only.
  - In-app chat: a server-side, provider-agnostic Vercel AI SDK agent loop (OpenAI, Azure, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, ...). The model provider is built on the backend from the integration credentials, so the API key never leaves the backend. The loop offers only resolver-allowed tools, auto-runs read tools (re-entering the live router as the logged-in user) and routes mutating / destructive tools through propose/apply. Durable conversation persistence (`ai_conversations`, `ai_messages`, owner-scoped RPCs) plus a streaming chat UI with a confirm-card component and per-integration model picker.
  - Per-conversation permission mode (Claude-Code-style approve/auto), a durable `permission_mode` column on `ai_conversations` (default `approve`). `read` always auto-runs in both modes; `mutate` inherits the mode (auto-applies server-side in `auto`, confirm-carded in `approve`); `destructive` ALWAYS requires the human `applyTool` in both modes. Security invariant (structural + tested): the mode is consulted only on the `mutate` branch, so no `(effect, mode)` pair routes a destructive tool to auto-apply.
  - Per-integration LLM spend cap (optional `spendCap` = `tokenBudget` + `windowMinutes`, default OFF). Spend is tracked in a shared-Postgres `ai_spend` ledger; enforcement is a rolling-window SUM run before each turn (HTTP 429 over budget). Per-principal tool rate-limit budgets are a rolling COUNT over `ai_tool_calls`, enforced on both transports. An absent / empty / incomplete `spendCap` is treated as "no cap" rather than rejected.
  - Full tool-call replay: `ai_messages.model_messages` (jsonb) persists the canonical AI-SDK `ResponseMessage[]` per turn and replays them verbatim on the next turn; legacy rows fall back to text-only replay.
  - Enforced no-secret-leak scrubbing: `appendMessage` runs `scrubContent` on every write, redacting credential-shaped keys and high-confidence credential values; a canary regression test asserts injected secrets are stripped. A hardening test suite asserts no secret appears in any AI-surface DTO and that handler-side authz holds when the model misbehaves.
  - Provider correctness: the chat provider uses `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`'s `chatModel` (plain `/chat/completions`), so OpenAI-compatible gateways (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, vLLM) no longer reject turns with `invalid_prompt`; `@ai-sdk/openai` is removed.

  BREAKING CHANGES:

  - The `AiTool` contract (`@checkstack/ai-common`) gained a `TRpc` type parameter, and both `dryRun` and `execute` now receive a USER-SCOPED `rpcClient` arg bound to the originating user. Every plugin procedure a tool calls re-enters the live router AS THAT USER, so handler-side authorization (access rules AND per-resource/team scope) is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC call - closing a prior privilege-escalation where tools captured a trusted service client at construction. A hand-authored tool MUST resolve its plugin client from this per-call arg and MUST NOT capture a trusted service client at factory scope. Tool factories that previously took `{ rpcClient }` should drop that parameter.
  - `AiToolProjectionExtensionPoint.expose` no longer takes a second `pluginMetadata` argument; the owning metadata lives on `input.sourcePluginMetadata`. Callers must drop the second argument.

  State and scale: conversations, messages, the audit log, proposal tokens, the rate-limit counter, and the spend ledger all live in shared Postgres, so every pod answers identically and the agent loop is resumable on any pod. The only pod-local state is the live MCP connection registry (bookkeeping, never a source of truth). Cross-pod conversation readback, the spend cap, and the tool budget are verified by env-gated two-pod integration tests.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Automations now run as a configured service account, removing implicit god-mode from the dispatch path.

  BREAKING: every automation must declare a `runAs` application (service account). Previously every automation action ran as the trusted service client, bypassing all access-rule, per-resource, and team-scope checks - so an automation could touch any team's data. Now each automation runs as a bounded `application` principal, and every data-access call an action makes is authorized exactly as that identity. An automation with no `runAs` fails to run with a clear error rather than falling back to the trusted client; legacy automations must be assigned a service account before they run again.

  What changed:

  - New top-level field `runAs` on automations (a `run_as_application_id` column + create/update inputs; `AutomationSchema.runAs`). Required on create; GitOps sets it via the `run-as` metadata label.
  - A new `coreServices.rpcClientAs(applicationId)` mints a short-lived, backend-signed app-principal token; the auth service resolves it LIVE to an `application` principal (reusing `enrichApplicationPrincipal`), so it flows through full `autoAuthMiddleware` enforcement. The dispatch engine threads this client into every action's `execute` as the required `context.rpcClient`.
  - Bind authority (anti-escalation): a user may only bind an application whose access rules are a subset of their own (`isApplicationBindable`); `getBindableApplications` lists only bindable apps, and the create/update handlers enforce the check.
  - `notification.sendTransactional` moves from service-only to access-gated (`notification.send`, a new access rule), so an automation's `runAs` can call the built-in `notify_user` / `notification.send` actions; trusted services still bypass via short-circuit.
  - A "Run as (Service Account)" picker in the automation editor, populated from `getBindableApplications` (server-side filtered to bindable apps), seeding from the loaded `runAs` on edit and passing it into create + update. First-class teaching UX: an inline info banner, a blocked Save with an inline hint until one is chosen, and an empty state linking to the Applications admin + docs when none are bindable.

  State and scale: `runAs` resolution is a pure read over shared tables; the app-principal token is self-contained and verified statelessly, so the per-run client is correct under horizontal scale.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Harden config-versioning so stored configs always migrate-then-validate and broken migration chains fail fast at boot.

  - `@checkstack/backend-api` `Versioned<T>` gains `parseAssumingV1` (migrate-from-v1 then validate leniently, runtime path), `parseStrictAssumingV1` (migrate then validate strictly, editor path), and `validateMigrationChainFromV1()`. A standalone pure helper `assertMigrationChainFromV1({ version, migrations })` is the single shared implementation behind the constructor guard and `validateMigrationChainFromV1`.
  - `Versioned` now validates its own v1 -> `version` chain in the constructor, which runs at module import / plugin registration. A new `no-restricted-syntax` ESLint rule bans calling `parse` / `safeParse` / `parseAsync` / `strict` directly on a `Versioned`'s `.schema` member.
  - Auth strategy migration chains are validated at the `betterAuthExtensionPoint.addStrategy` chokepoint (`@checkstack/auth-backend`).
  - Automation action AND trigger configs migrate-then-validate (lenient at dispatch, strict in the editor validator, recursing into `choose`/`parallel`/`repeat`/`sequence` blocks). The `run_script` / `run_shell` action configs bump to `version: 2` dropping the removed `sandbox` key, fixing the editor's `Unrecognized key: sandbox` error.
  - Anomaly read path now validates: `getAnomalyConfig` / `getAnomalyAssignmentConfig` run stored records through `Versioned.parseRecord`; `PartialAnomalySettingsSchema` moved to `@checkstack/anomaly-common`. Notification ConfigService reads thread the migrations argument, and per-strategy `userConfig` is migrate-then-validated before `send()`.
  - gitops-apply migrate-then-validates authored health-check config; integration connection validation routes through `safeValidate`. The latent HTTP health-check `result` schema (at `version: 3` with no migrations) now ships a pass-through v1 -> v2 -> v3 chain.

  BREAKING CHANGES (fail-fast at boot, intended):

  - Any `Versioned` config with `version > 1` and an incomplete or non-contiguous migration chain now throws at construction (boot) instead of failing lazily on first read. This covers every `Versioned` instance repo-wide, including future plugin types. Out-of-tree plugins shipping such a config must add the missing migration step(s); all in-repo strategies already have complete chains.
  - An auth strategy declaring `configVersion > 1` without a complete chain throws at registration.
  - A trigger's per-automation config is now a versioned `config: Versioned<TConfig>` instead of a bare `configSchema?`. Plugins registering triggers with `configSchema:` must wrap it: `config: new Versioned({ version: 1, schema })`. The underlying schema stays reachable via `config.schema`; triggers without per-automation config are unaffected.

  State and scale: all affected reads resolve from shared Postgres / in-process registries, so every pod sees the same migrated answer. No new framework-owned current-state store.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

### Patch Changes

- f23f3c9: Add `correlationMiddleware` to `@checkstack/backend-api` and apply it
  to every plugin/core router so each request carries a stable
  `x-correlation-id` (read from the inbound header, or freshly minted
  via `crypto.randomUUID()` when absent) and an auto-injected child
  logger bound with `{ correlationId, pluginId, userId? }`. The ID is
  echoed back on the response header so the caller can correlate their
  client-side trace to the server logs.

  The `Logger` interface in `@checkstack/backend-api` now formally
  documents the structured-metadata convention (`logger.info("msg",
{ ...meta })`) alongside the long-standing varargs shape. Winston's
  splat handling already routes both shapes through the same vararg
  slot, so existing call sites are unaffected. A new optional
  `Logger.child(meta)` method captures the metadata-binding contract the
  new middleware relies on; production loggers always implement it,
  minimal test mocks may omit it (the middleware falls back gracefully).

  `RpcContext` grew two optional `Headers` bags, `requestHeaders` and
  `responseHeaders`, populated by the outer Hono `/api/*` and `/rest/*`
  handlers in `@checkstack/backend`. They are write-through observation
  points for middleware; an `RpcContext` constructed without them (S2S
  clients, tests) keeps working — the echo is a silent no-op and the ID
  is still bound onto the child logger for server-side correlation.

  The scaffolding template in `@checkstack/scripts` was updated so any
  new plugin generated via `bun run create` wires the middleware in the
  expected `.use(correlationMiddleware).use(autoAuthMiddleware)` order
  out of the box.

## 0.4.27

### Patch Changes

- b33fb4d: Refresh `bun.lock` to clear MEDIUM-severity Trivy advisories on transitive
  runtime dependencies. No public API change — bumping every workspace
  package that lists `@orpc/server` as a direct dep so consumers re-resolve
  the optional `ws` peer to the patched release on their next install.

  - `ws` `8.20.0` → `8.20.1` (CVE-2026-45736). Pulled into the install tree
    as `@orpc/server`'s optional WebSocket peer; Bun auto-installs it into
    every backend package that depends on `@orpc/server`, so a stale 8.20.0
    ships in the consumer's `node_modules` until the parent package
    re-resolves.
  - `brace-expansion` `5.0.5` → `5.0.6` (CVE-2026-45149). Pulled in only
    through dev tooling (`minimatch@10` via `@typescript-eslint` and
    `storybook`'s `glob@13`), so it does not ship to consumers and no
    workspace `package.json` lists it; the lockfile bump alone clears the
    finding for the Docker image and the local dev tree. No version bump
    is attributed to this advisory.

  The fix lives entirely in `bun.lock` — no `package.json`, `overrides`, or
  `resolutions` change is needed because both parent ranges (`minimatch@10
→ brace-expansion@^5.0.5`, `@orpc/server / storybook / happy-dom →
ws@>=8.18.x`) already accept the patched releases, and `bun install`
  keeps the resolved versions sticky after the initial `bun update`.

## 0.4.26

### Patch Changes

- 080627f: Pin `kysely` to `^0.28.17` as a direct dependency to resolve CVE-2026-44635
  (JSON-path traversal injection via unsanitized path-leg metacharacters in
  `JSONPathBuilder.key()` / `.at()`). better-auth lists kysely as a peer
  dependency, and Bun was auto-resolving it through the optionalPeers
  mechanism — pinning here keeps us inside better-auth's peer range
  (`^0.28.5`) while picking up the fix.

  Two unrelated transitive vulnerabilities (`fast-uri` 3.1.0 → 3.1.2 covering
  CVE-2026-6321/6322, `protobufjs` 7.5.5 → 7.5.8 covering
  CVE-2026-44289/44290/44291/44293) were resolved by a plain lockfile refresh
  and do not require package version bumps.

## 0.4.22

### Patch Changes

- 32d52c6: Fix and improve password reset flow + email branding:

  - **Fix**: password reset emails were failing with "Malformed password reset URL: missing token parameter". Better-auth puts the reset token in the URL path (`/reset-password/{token}`), not as a `?token=` query param, so the previous URL-parsing logic always failed. Now uses the `token` argument better-auth passes to `sendResetPassword` directly.
  - **UX**: the reset password page now validates the token on load via a new anonymous `validateResetToken` endpoint, so users see "Invalid Link" / "Link Expired" before typing a password rather than after submitting. Tokens are 24-char nanoid-style values (~143 bits of entropy), so exposing validity does not enable enumeration.
  - **Fix**: transactional notifications were hardcoded to `importance: "critical"`, causing password reset emails to display a misleading "CRITICAL" badge. The `sendTransactional` contract now accepts an optional `importance` field that defaults to `"info"`.
  - **Branding**: redesigned the email layout (`wrapInEmailLayout`) with a Checkstack-style engineering aesthetic — dark header with grid pattern, monospace importance badge, hardened CTA button (Outlook VML fallback + explicit text color), and force-light color scheme to prevent client auto-inversion from breaking text legibility.

### Patch Changes

- 889dd8c: Fix session loss for LDAP and SAML authentication strategies

  The auth bridge was joining multiple `Set-Cookie` headers into a single comma-separated string, which corrupted cookie attributes. This caused the `session_token` cookie to inherit the 5-minute `maxAge` from the `session_data` cache cookie instead of the intended 7-day expiry. After the cookie expired from the browser, `get-session` returned `null` and all API calls failed with 401.

  Changed the `createSession` RPC contract to return `setCookies: string[]` (array) instead of `setCookie: string`, and updated LDAP/SAML consumers to use `Headers.append("Set-Cookie", ...)` to set each cookie as a separate header.

## 0.4.13

### Patch Changes

- e01945b: Reduce excessive /api/auth/get-session requests

  - Enable better-auth's `cookieCache` on the server (5-minute TTL) so repeated session
    checks verify a signed cookie instead of querying the database. Compatible with
    horizontal scaling since validation uses the shared `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.

  - Introduce a `SessionProvider` React context that fetches the session exactly once
    at the top of the component tree. All 7+ components that previously called
    `useSession()` independently now read from this shared context — eliminating
    duplicate HTTP requests on every page load.

  - Remove the `useAuthClient()` hook which created per-component better-auth client
    instances via `useMemo`, causing separate nanostore atoms and independent fetches.
    All imperative usages (signIn, signUp, resetPassword, etc.) now use the singleton
    `getAuthClientLazy()` instead.

## 0.4.12

### Patch Changes

- c0c0ed2: Introduce generic "Login Flows" to allow authentication strategies to define their own interaction patterns (form, redirect, or oauth) during registration. This fixes an issue where LDAP login attempts were incorrectly routed through the standard social login flow by instead providing a dedicated credential collection form for LDAP.
- c0c0ed2: Refactor manual session creation to use a secure, bridged oRPC endpoint. This ensures that custom authentication strategies (LDAP, SAML) leverage Better-Auth's native session establishment utilities, including cryptographic signing and reliable cookie attribute management.

### Minor Changes

- d94121b: Add group-to-role mapping for SAML and LDAP authentication

  **Features:**

  - SAML and LDAP users can now be automatically assigned Checkstack roles based on their directory group memberships
  - Configure group mappings in the authentication strategy settings with dynamic role dropdowns
  - Managed role sync: roles configured in mappings are fully synchronized (added when user gains group, removed when user leaves group)
  - Unmanaged roles (manually assigned, not in any mapping) are preserved during sync
  - Optional default role for all users from a directory

  **Bug Fix:**

  - Fixed `x-options-resolver` not working for fields inside arrays with `.default([])` in DynamicForm schemas

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 95eeec7: # Auto-login after credential registration

  Users are now automatically logged in after successful registration when using the credential (email & password) authentication strategy.

  ## Changes

  ### Backend (`@checkstack/auth-backend`)

  - Added `autoSignIn: true` to the `emailAndPassword` configuration in better-auth
  - Users no longer need to manually log in after registration; a session is created immediately upon successful sign-up

  ### Frontend (`@checkstack/auth-frontend`)

  - Updated `RegisterPage` to use full page navigation after registration to ensure the session state refreshes correctly
  - Updated `LoginPage` to use full page navigation after login to ensure fresh permissions state when switching between users

- Updated dependencies [9faec1f]
- Updated dependencies [827b286]
- Updated dependencies [f533141]

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8e889b4: Add consumer group support to Queue API for distributed event system. BREAKING: consume() now requires ConsumeOptions with consumerGroup parameter.

### Minor Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- 32f2535: Refactor application role assignment

  - Removed role selection from the application creation dialog
  - New applications now automatically receive the "Applications" role
  - Roles are now manageable inline in the Applications table (similar to user role management)
  - Added informational alert in create dialog explaining default role behavior

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.
