# @checkstack/release

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- f8ce585: Improved RPC error logging to include full stack traces for procedure errors. Previously, errors inside RPC handlers (such as database table not found errors) resulted in silent 500 responses. Now these errors are logged with detailed information to the backend console for easier debugging.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- d6f7449: Add availability statistics display to HealthCheckSystemOverview

  - New `getAvailabilityStats` RPC endpoint that calculates availability percentages for 31-day and 365-day periods
  - Availability is calculated as `(healthyRuns / totalRuns) * 100`
  - Data is sourced from both daily aggregates and recent raw runs to include the most up-to-date information
  - Frontend displays availability stats with color-coded badges (green ≥99.9%, yellow ≥99%, red <99%)
  - Shows total run counts for each period

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- e58e994: Fix runtime error in AutoChartGrid when mapping over values with undefined elements

  The filter functions `getAllBooleanValuesWithTime` and `getAllStringValuesWithTime` incorrectly checked `v !== null` instead of `v !== undefined`, allowing undefined elements to pass through and crash when accessing `.value`.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- dd16be7: Fix plugin schema isolation: create schema before migrations run

  Previously, schemas were only created when `coreServices.database` was resolved (after migrations), causing tables to be created in the `public` schema instead of plugin-specific schemas. Now schemas are created immediately before migrations run.

  Also removed the `public` fallback from migration search_path to make errors more visible if schema creation fails.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- deec10c: Fix production crash when opening health check accordion and enable sourcemaps

  - Fixed TypeError in `HealthCheckLatencyChart` where recharts Tooltip content function was returning `undefined` instead of `null`, causing "can't access property 'value', o is undefined" error
  - Enabled production sourcemaps in Vite config for better debugging of production errors

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f81b60: ### Clickable Run History with Deep Linking

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Added `getRunById` service method to fetch a single health check run by ID

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `getRunById` RPC procedure for fetching individual runs
  - Added `historyRun` route for deep linking to specific runs (`/history/:systemId/:configurationId/:runId`)

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Table rows in Recent Runs and Run History now navigate to detailed view instead of expanding inline
  - Added "Selected Run" card that displays when navigating to a specific run
  - Extracted `ExpandedResultView` into reusable component
  - Fixed layout shift during table pagination by preserving previous data while loading
  - Removed accordion expansion in favor of consistent navigation UX

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 223081d: Add icon support to PageLayout and improve mobile responsiveness

  **PageLayout Icons:**

  - Added required `icon` prop to `PageLayout` and `PageHeader` components that accepts a Lucide icon component reference
  - Icons are rendered with consistent `h-6 w-6 text-primary` styling
  - Updated all page components to include appropriate icons in their headers

  **Mobile Layout Improvements:**

  - Standardized responsive padding in main app shell (`p-3` on mobile, `p-6` on desktop)
  - Added `CardHeaderRow` component for mobile-safe card headers with proper wrapping
  - Improved `DateRangeFilter` responsive behavior with vertical stacking on mobile
  - Migrated pages to use `PageLayout` for consistent responsive behavior

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- db1f56f: Add ephemeral field stripping to reduce database storage for health checks

  - Added `x-ephemeral` metadata flag to `HealthResultMeta` for marking fields that should not be persisted
  - All health result factory functions (`healthResultString`, `healthResultNumber`, `healthResultBoolean`, `healthResultArray`, `healthResultJSONPath`) now accept `x-ephemeral`
  - Added `stripEphemeralFields()` utility to remove ephemeral fields before database storage
  - Integrated ephemeral field stripping into `queue-executor.ts` for all collector results
  - HTTP Request collector now explicitly marks `body` as ephemeral

  This significantly reduces database storage for health checks with large response bodies, while still allowing assertions to run against the full response at execution time.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 66a3963: Update database types to use SafeDatabase

  - Updated all database type declarations from `NodePgDatabase` to `SafeDatabase` for compile-time safety

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 8a87cd4: Fixed query retry behavior for 401/403 errors

  API calls that return 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) errors are no longer retried, as these are definitive auth responses that won't succeed on retry. This prevents unnecessary loading states and network requests.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 18fa8e3: Add notification suppression toggle for maintenance windows

  **New Feature:** When creating or editing a maintenance window, you can now enable "Suppress health notifications" to prevent health status change notifications from being sent for affected systems while the maintenance is active (in_progress status). This is useful for planned downtime where health alerts are expected and would otherwise create noise.

  **Changes:**

  - Added `suppressNotifications` field to maintenance schema
  - Added new service-to-service API `hasActiveMaintenanceWithSuppression`
  - Healthcheck queue executor now checks for suppression before sending notifications
  - MaintenanceEditor UI includes new toggle checkbox

  **Bug Fix:** Fixed migration system to correctly set PostgreSQL search_path when running plugin migrations. Previously, migrations could fail with "relation does not exist" errors because the schema context wasn't properly set.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 83557c7: ## Multi-Type Editor Support for Webhooks

  - Updated webhook provider to use new multi-type editor field for body templates

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- d94121b: Add group-to-role mapping for SAML and LDAP authentication

  **Features:**

  - SAML and LDAP users can now be automatically assigned Checkstack roles based on their directory group memberships
  - Configure group mappings in the authentication strategy settings with dynamic role dropdowns
  - Managed role sync: roles configured in mappings are fully synchronized (added when user gains group, removed when user leaves group)
  - Unmanaged roles (manually assigned, not in any mapping) are preserved during sync
  - Optional default role for all users from a directory

  **Bug Fix:**

  - Fixed `x-options-resolver` not working for fields inside arrays with `.default([])` in DynamicForm schemas

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- cf5f245: Added Gotify notification provider for self-hosted push notifications. Features include priority mapping (info→5, warning→7, critical→10), action URL extras, and configurable server URL.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- cad3073: Fixed notification group subscription for catalog groups:
  - Fixed group ID format using colon separator instead of dots and missing entity type prefix
  - Fixed subscription button state not updating after subscribe/unsubscribe by using refetch instead of invalidateQueries

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- f6464a2: Fix theme toggle showing incorrect state when system theme is used

  - Added `resolvedTheme` property to `ThemeProvider` that returns the actual computed theme ("light" or "dark"), resolving "system" to the user's OS preference
  - Updated `NavbarThemeToggle` and `ThemeToggleMenuItem` to use `resolvedTheme` instead of `theme` for determining toggle state
  - Changed default theme from "light" to "system" so non-logged-in users respect their OS color scheme preference

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- dd07c14: Fix collector add button failing in HTTP contexts by replacing `crypto.randomUUID()` with the `uuid` package

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- df6ac7b: Added onboarding flow and user profile

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4eed42d: Fix "No QueryClient set" error in containerized builds

  **Problem**: The containerized application was throwing "No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one" errors during plugin registration. This didn't happen in dev mode.

  **Root Cause**: The `@tanstack/react-query` package was being bundled separately in different workspace packages, causing multiple React Query contexts. The `QueryClientProvider` from the main app wasn't visible to plugin code due to this module duplication.

  **Changes**:

  - `@checkstack/frontend-api`: Export `useQueryClient` from the centralized React Query import, ensuring all packages use the same context
  - `@checkstack/dashboard-frontend`: Import `useQueryClient` from `@checkstack/frontend-api` instead of directly from `@tanstack/react-query`, and remove the direct dependency
  - `@checkstack/frontend`: Add `@tanstack/react-query` to Vite's `resolve.dedupe` as a safety net

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a27800: Changed recurring job scheduling from completion-based to wall-clock scheduling.

  **Breaking Change:** Recurring jobs now run on a fixed interval (like BullMQ) regardless of whether the previous job has completed. If a job takes longer than `intervalSeconds`, multiple jobs may run concurrently.

  **Improvements:**

  - Fixed job ID collision bug when rescheduling within the same millisecond
  - Configuration updates via `scheduleRecurring()` now properly cancel old intervals before starting new ones
  - Added `heartbeatIntervalMs` to config for resilient job recovery after system sleep

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f533141: Enforce health result factory function usage via branded types

  - Added `healthResultSchema()` builder that enforces the use of factory functions at compile-time
  - Added `healthResultArray()` factory for array fields (e.g., DNS resolved values)
  - Added branded `HealthResultField<T>` type to mark schemas created by factory functions
  - Consolidated `ChartType` and `HealthResultMeta` into `@checkstack/common` as single source of truth
  - Updated all 12 health check strategies and 11 collectors to use `healthResultSchema()`
  - Using raw `z.number()` etc. inside `healthResultSchema()` now causes a TypeScript error

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 97c5a6b: Fixed DOM clobbering issue in DynamicForm by prefixing field IDs with 'field-'. Previously, schema fields with names matching native DOM properties (like 'nodeName', 'tagName', 'innerHTML') could shadow those properties, causing floating-ui and React to crash during DOM traversal.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f5b1f49: Updated frontend URL environment variable from `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` to `BASE_URL` for consistency.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cb82e4d: Improved `counter` and `pie` auto-chart types to show frequency distributions instead of just the latest value. Both chart types now count occurrences of each unique value across all runs/buckets, making them more intuitive for visualizing data like HTTP status codes.

  Changed HTTP health check chart annotations: `statusCode` now uses `pie` chart (distribution view), `contentType` now uses `counter` chart (frequency count).

  Fixed scrollbar hopping when health check signals update the accordion content. All charts now update silently without layout shift or loading state flicker.

  Refactored health check visualization architecture:

  - `HealthCheckStatusTimeline` and `HealthCheckLatencyChart` now accept `HealthCheckDiagramSlotContext` directly, handling data transformation internally
  - `HealthCheckDiagram` refactored to accept context from parent, ensuring all visualizations share the same data source and update together on signals
  - `HealthCheckSystemOverview` simplified to use `useHealthCheckData` hook for consolidated data fetching with automatic signal-driven refresh

  Added `silentRefetch()` method to `usePagination` hook for background data refreshes without showing loading indicators.

  Fixed `useSignal` hook to use a ref pattern internally, preventing stale closure issues. Callbacks now always access the latest values without requiring manual memoization or refs in consumer components.

  Added signal handling to `useHealthCheckData` hook for automatic chart refresh when health check runs complete.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d20d274: Initial release of all @checkstack packages. Rebranded from Checkmate to Checkstack with new npm organization @checkstack and domain checkstack.dev.
