# @checkstack/gitops-common

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c40b5b: feat: add GitOps Entity System foundation — entity envelope schema, Entity Kind Registry extension point, secret field utility, secret resolution engine, provenance tracking, and RPC contract
- 6c40b5b: Generalized provenance system and GitOps frontend plugin

  **Breaking**: `EntityKindDefinition.reconcile()` now returns `{ entityId: string }` instead of `void`. Plugins must return the plugin-specific entity ID (e.g., catalog system UUID) so the engine can store it in provenance.

  - Added `entityId` column to the provenance table (non-nullable)
  - Reconciler engine passes `existingEntityId` to plugins for updates
  - `getProvenance` now supports lookup by `entityId` in addition to `entityName`
  - Added provider CRUD endpoints: `createProvider`, `updateProvider`, `deleteProvider`
  - Created `gitops-frontend` plugin with provider management, secret management, and sync status dashboard
  - Removed `gitops_entity_name` metadata markers from catalog entities
  - Removed `findSystemByGitOpsName`, `deleteSystemByGitOpsName` (and Group equivalents) from EntityService
  - Added provenance-based UI locking in catalog-frontend: edit/delete/drag disabled for GitOps-managed systems and groups

- 6c40b5b: ### GitOps Ecosystem: Healthcheck Kind Registration (Phase 5)

  **gitops-common**: Added required `resolveEntityRef` to `ReconcileContext`, enabling extension reconcilers to resolve cross-kind entity references (e.g., healthcheck refs in System extensions).

  **gitops-backend**: Updated reconciler to populate `resolveEntityRef` by querying local provenance — no RPC round-trip needed.

  **healthcheck-backend**: Registered `kind: Healthcheck` and `System → healthchecks` extension with the EntityKindRegistry:

  - Validates strategy configs against registered strategy schemas at reconcile time
  - Validates collector configs against registered collector schemas at reconcile time
  - Manages system ↔ healthcheck associations with automatic stale removal

  **healthcheck-frontend**: Added GitOps provenance locking to the HealthCheck IDE editor — GitOps-managed health checks show a lock banner and disable editing.

  **catalog-backend**: Updated test fixtures for new required `resolveEntityRef` context field.

- 6c40b5b: Add Kind Registry browser and developer documentation

  - Added `gitopsAccess.kinds.read` access rule for standalone Kind Registry access
  - Added `describeKinds()` method to the internal entity kind registry, serializing Zod schemas to JSON Schema
  - Added `listKinds` RPC endpoint gated by the new access rule
  - Created standalone Kind Registry page with schema visualization, extension listing, and auto-generated YAML examples
  - Added Kind Registry link to the user menu
  - Created developer documentation for entity kind and extension registration in `docs/backend/gitops-entity-kinds.md`
