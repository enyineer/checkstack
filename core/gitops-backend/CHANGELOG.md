## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- adc89a8: Fix GitOps engine skipping retry of failed entities

  - Updated the fast-path condition in the Reconciler engine to only skip reconciliation if the entity is in a `synced` state.
  - Prevents entities from remaining permanently stuck in an error state without being retried if the underlying YAML file is not modified.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- b53a40e: Fix GitOps entity update failures due to pending error records

  - Ensured the `existingEntityId` parameter in the Reconciler engine is set to `undefined` instead of a `"pending-UUID"` when handling entities that failed to sync initially.
  - Hardened the `Healthcheck` GitOps kind logic to explicitly ignore `"pending-"` IDs, preventing SQL update errors on synthetic provenance IDs.
  - Fixed a bug where resolving YAML syntax errors would cause the subsequent sync to fail with `failed query: update [...]` because it attempted to update the nonexistent `"pending-"` entity instead of creating a new one.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 57d54de: Fix GitOps Healthcheck reconciliation engine and Kind Registry UI

  - Mandated fully qualified IDs for all healthcheck strategies and collector definitions.
  - Refactored the Kind Registry UI to display schema documentation in beautifully formatted, interactive YAML examples.
  - Entity Envelope Fields and Base Spec Schema are now displayed in collapsed accordions.
  - Fixed condition logic that broke the collector documentation display.
  - Enhanced UX by dynamically injecting fully-qualified strategy variants directly into the YAML examples.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ef367a: Added `registerSpecSchemaDocumentation` to EntityKindRegistry to allow plugins to provide detailed JSON Schemas for specific configurations. The frontend now displays these registered schemas as dropdown alternatives, improving the developer experience when authoring GitOps configurations.
- cb65e9d: ### Schema-driven secret resolution, rotation invalidation, and security hardening

  **Breaking**: Replaced `{ secretRef: "..." }` object syntax with `${{ secrets.NAME }}` template interpolation. The `secretField()`, `secretRefSchema`, `isSecretRef`, `SecretRef`, and `ResolvedSecretField` exports have been removed from `@checkstack/gitops-common`.

  **Breaking**: `ReconcileContext.resolveSecretsBySchema()` now returns `{ resolved: T; warnings: string[] }` instead of `T` directly. Plugins must destructure the result. Warnings contain messages for `${{ secrets.NAME }}` templates found in non-secret fields (fields without `x-secret` annotation).

  **New features**:

  - Secrets can be referenced in **any string field** using `${{ secrets.NAME }}` syntax
  - Inline interpolation is supported: `"postgres://user:${{ secrets.DB_PASS }}@host/db"`
  - Resolution is **schema-driven** — reuses the existing `configString({ "x-secret": true })` pattern from DynamicForm
  - Secret rotation now automatically invalidates affected entities, triggering re-reconciliation on the next sync cycle
  - New `getSecretUsage` RPC endpoint to look up which entities reference a given secret
  - Secrets UI now shows an expandable usage panel per secret showing referencing entities
  - Reconciliation warnings: templates in non-secret fields are detected and surfaced in the provenance UI
  - New `secretNameSchema` and `SECRET_NAME_REGEX` exports for validating secret names

  **Security**:

  - Secret names are validated at creation: must start with a letter, contain only `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, max 63 chars
  - Secrets are validated to exist at sync time but **not pre-resolved** into the spec
  - Templates in `metadata` fields are **rejected** to prevent secret leaks via display fields
  - Only fields with `x-secret` schema annotations get resolved — no escape hatch
  - Templates in non-secret fields emit warnings (stored in provenance, visible in UI) instead of silently passing

  **Migration**: Update YAML descriptors to use `${{ secrets.NAME }}` instead of `secretRef: name`. Remove `secretField()` imports from plugin schemas — use `configString({ "x-secret": true })` to annotate secret fields. Destructure `const { resolved } = await context.resolveSecretsBySchema({ value, schema })` (return type changed from `T` to `{ resolved: T; warnings: string[] }`).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8ef367a]
- Updated dependencies [cb65e9d]
  - @checkstack/gitops-common@0.2.0

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 79cf5f8: ### GitOps: Fix sync lifecycle management

  - Schedule recurring sync job immediately when creating a provider (previously required server restart)
  - Reschedule recurring job when provider's sync interval is updated
  - Cancel recurring job when provider is deleted
  - Fix manual sync trigger being silently dropped due to job ID deduplication

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 86bab6a: ### GitOps: Fix authentication token handling

  - Made `authToken` optional in `ReconcileProviderParams` and `ScraperOptions` to support unauthenticated access to public repositories
  - GitHub and GitLab scrapers now conditionally set authentication headers only when a token is provided
  - Sync worker now decrypts the encrypted `authToken` from the database before passing it to scrapers, fixing authentication failures caused by sending encrypted values in HTTP headers

  ### SLO: Fix premature Nines Club achievement unlock

  - The "Nines Club" achievement now requires both ≥99.99% availability **and** a 365-day compliance streak, preventing immediate unlock on newly created SLOs with 100% default availability

  ### SLO: Align frontend achievement descriptions with backend criteria

  - Fixed mismatched descriptions for Iron Uptime (7-day, not 30), Diamond Uptime (30-day, not 90), Clean Sheet (rolling window, not quarter), Full Coverage (3+ SLOs, not all systems in group), and Nines Club (99.99%)

  ### SLO: Enrich milestones with system names

  - The `getRecentMilestones` endpoint now resolves human-readable system names via the Catalog API instead of returning raw system IDs

- Updated dependencies [86bab6a]
  - @checkstack/gitops-common@0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c40b5b: feat: add GitOps Entity System foundation — entity envelope schema, Entity Kind Registry extension point, secret field utility, secret resolution engine, provenance tracking, and RPC contract
- 6c40b5b: Generalized provenance system and GitOps frontend plugin

  **Breaking**: `EntityKindDefinition.reconcile()` now returns `{ entityId: string }` instead of `void`. Plugins must return the plugin-specific entity ID (e.g., catalog system UUID) so the engine can store it in provenance.

  - Added `entityId` column to the provenance table (non-nullable)
  - Reconciler engine passes `existingEntityId` to plugins for updates
  - `getProvenance` now supports lookup by `entityId` in addition to `entityName`
  - Added provider CRUD endpoints: `createProvider`, `updateProvider`, `deleteProvider`
  - Created `gitops-frontend` plugin with provider management, secret management, and sync status dashboard
  - Removed `gitops_entity_name` metadata markers from catalog entities
  - Removed `findSystemByGitOpsName`, `deleteSystemByGitOpsName` (and Group equivalents) from EntityService
  - Added provenance-based UI locking in catalog-frontend: edit/delete/drag disabled for GitOps-managed systems and groups

- 6c40b5b: ### GitOps Ecosystem: Healthcheck Kind Registration (Phase 5)

  **gitops-common**: Added required `resolveEntityRef` to `ReconcileContext`, enabling extension reconcilers to resolve cross-kind entity references (e.g., healthcheck refs in System extensions).

  **gitops-backend**: Updated reconciler to populate `resolveEntityRef` by querying local provenance — no RPC round-trip needed.

  **healthcheck-backend**: Registered `kind: Healthcheck` and `System → healthchecks` extension with the EntityKindRegistry:

  - Validates strategy configs against registered strategy schemas at reconcile time
  - Validates collector configs against registered collector schemas at reconcile time
  - Manages system ↔ healthcheck associations with automatic stale removal

  **healthcheck-frontend**: Added GitOps provenance locking to the HealthCheck IDE editor — GitOps-managed health checks show a lock banner and disable editing.

  **catalog-backend**: Updated test fixtures for new required `resolveEntityRef` context field.

- 6c40b5b: Add GitOps discovery and sync engine (Phase 2)

  - YAML document parser with multi-document support and SHA-256 content hashing for diff detection
  - GitHub scraper: org/user repo enumeration, single-repo mode, default branch resolution, recursive Git Trees API, minimatch path filtering, Link header pagination
  - GitLab scraper: group project enumeration (including subgroups), single-project mode, recursive tree walking, minimatch filtering, x-next-page pagination
  - Configurable `baseUrl` per provider for GitHub Enterprise and self-managed GitLab instances
  - Reconciliation orchestrator: scrape → parse → validate → resolve secrets → reconcile (base + extensions) → provenance tracking → orphan detection
  - Sync worker: recurring queue jobs per provider, one-off manual trigger via triggerSync RPC
  - Per-entity error isolation ensures individual failures don't halt the sync

- 6c40b5b: Add Kind Registry browser and developer documentation

  - Added `gitopsAccess.kinds.read` access rule for standalone Kind Registry access
  - Added `describeKinds()` method to the internal entity kind registry, serializing Zod schemas to JSON Schema
  - Added `listKinds` RPC endpoint gated by the new access rule
  - Created standalone Kind Registry page with schema visualization, extension listing, and auto-generated YAML examples
  - Added Kind Registry link to the user menu
  - Created developer documentation for entity kind and extension registration in `docs/backend/gitops-entity-kinds.md`

### Patch Changes

- 6c40b5b: Register catalog System and Group as GitOps entity kinds

  - **catalog-backend**: Registers `kind: System` and `kind: Group` with the GitOps Entity Kind Registry. The catalog now supports declarative management via YAML descriptors in Git repositories. Systems and groups are reconciled using the `metadata.gitops_entity_name` marker for cross-sync identity lookup.
  - **gitops-backend**: Wires up the delete reconciler for orphan cleanup — both automatic deletion (via `deletionPolicy: "auto"`) and manual orphan confirmation now invoke the owning plugin's `delete()` handler before removing provenance entries.
