# @checkstack/scripts

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e90aba5: Split the dev server out of `@checkstack/scripts` into a new
  `@checkstack/dev-server` package.

  **Why**: Previously `@checkstack/scripts` declared `@checkstack/backend`,
  `@checkstack/frontend`, `@checkstack/ui`, `vite`, and
  `@vitejs/plugin-react` as runtime dependencies so the bundled `dev`
  command could spawn a local Checkstack. That made `bunx
@checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` (and any other CLI usage) resolve the
  platform's full transitive dep graph from npm — which broke the
  `Version Packages` release run when one of those transitives
  (`@checkstack/cache-api@0.1.0`) hadn't been published yet, blocking
  plugin-pack validation for 40 plugins.

  **What changed**:

  - New package `@checkstack/dev-server` with the bin `checkstack-dev`. It
    owns the dev loop (backend spawn, Vite, file watcher) and is meant to
    be installed as a `devDependency` in plugin repos.
  - `@checkstack/backend` and `@checkstack/frontend` are _optional_ peer
    dependencies of dev-server; plugin authors only declare the one
    matching their plugin type.
  - `@checkstack/scripts` runtime deps slimmed to `@checkstack/common`,
    `tar`, `inquirer`, `handlebars`. The `dev` command was removed from
    the CLI (it had not shipped to users yet).
  - Plugin scaffolding templates now produce `dev` scripts that call
    `checkstack-dev` directly and add `@checkstack/dev-server` plus the
    matching platform package as devDependencies.
  - Documentation updated to reflect the new dev-loop entry point.

  Both bumps are minor since the project is in beta — the removed `dev`
  command and dropped transitive deps would normally be a major bump.

### Minor Changes

- 50e5f5f: Add `bunx @checkstack/scripts dev` — a local Checkstack dev server for
  plugin authors that runs from the plugin's own repo without a monorepo
  checkout.

  Mechanics:

  - The dev command spawns `core/backend`'s production entry as a child
    process with three env vars wired in:
    - `CHECKSTACK_DEV_PLUGIN_PATH=<cwd>` — backend skips filesystem
      discovery and imports the plugin at this path as a manual plugin.
    - `CHECKSTACK_DEV_EXTRA_PLUGIN_PATHS=<JSON array>` — additional
      backend plugins co-loaded as manual plugins. The dev command walks
      the plugin under dev's `package.json#dependencies` recursively to
      discover every `@checkstack/*-backend` package and pass their
      module paths through. Auto-includes
      `@checkstack/queue-memory-backend` +
      `@checkstack/cache-memory-backend` when no other queue/cache
      provider is in the dep graph, so `coreServices.queueManager` /
      `coreServices.cacheManager` always have a registered strategy on
      boot. Without this co-loading, plugins that depend on
      `healthcheck-backend`, `notification-backend`, etc. would hit
      unregistered services and the boot would deadlock.
    - `CHECKSTACK_DEV_AUTH=true` — backend registers a synthetic
      `AuthService` that auto-grants every registered access rule.
      Refused when `NODE_ENV=production` so accidental misuse is loud.
  - A file watcher under the plugin's `./src` triggers a full backend
    restart (debounced) on save. Bun's startup is sub-second for a single
    plugin, so the loop stays tight.
  - For frontend plugins (or bundle primaries with a `-frontend`
    sibling), the dev command additionally spawns a Vite dev server on
    port 5173 (configurable via `--frontend-port`). Vite serves
    `core/frontend`'s new `dev-main.tsx` shell — the same App.tsx,
    loadPlugins(), ThemeProvider, etc. that ship in production. The
    plugin module is mounted via a `virtual:checkstack-dev-plugin` alias
    Vite resolves at config time. React Fast Refresh works for component
    edits.
  - On boot, the dev command validates the plugin's `package.json`
    against the same `installPackageMetadataSchema` the runtime install
    pipeline uses, so missing required fields fail fast.

  Reuses 100% of the production boot code path — no parallel dev backend
  to drift from. New code surfaces:

  - `core/backend/src/services/dev-auth.ts` — the synthetic auth service.
    Inert unless `CHECKSTACK_DEV_AUTH=true`.
  - `core/scripts/src/commands/dev-server.ts` — the CLI command.
  - `core/scripts/src/commands/dev-deps-resolver.ts` — pure function that
    walks the plugin's deps and resolves the co-load set; covered by 8
    unit tests.
  - `core/scripts/src/commands/dev-frontend.ts` — Vite spawn helper.
  - `core/frontend/src/dev-main.tsx` — frontend dev-shell entry.

  `@checkstack/scripts` now depends on `@checkstack/backend`,
  `@checkstack/frontend`, `@checkstack/frontend-api`, `@checkstack/ui`,
  `vite`, and `@vitejs/plugin-react` so a `bunx` invocation pulls in
  everything needed for the dev server in one shot.

  Replaces the previous "three patterns" plugin-development guide with a
  single `bun run dev` workflow.

  A new ESLint rule branch in `no-extraneous-runtime-deps` ignores
  `virtual:` module specifiers (resolved by bundler aliases at runtime,
  not installed from npm).

  Scaffold templates updated for one-click compatibility — `bun run create`
  now produces plugin packages that pass the dev-server's
  `installPackageMetadataSchema` gate and ship `dev` / `pack` scripts plus
  `@checkstack/scripts` in devDependencies, so a freshly scaffolded plugin
  runs `bun run dev` without any further file edits. Required metadata
  (`description`, `author`, `license: "Elastic-2.0"`, `checkstack.pluginId`)
  is filled in by the scaffold; `@checkstack/scripts plugin-pack
--validate-only` accepts the rendered package.json directly. Templates
  also reformatted from one-line JSON-in-handlebars to readable
  multi-line.

  New scaffold tests in `core/scripts/src/templates.test.ts` render each
  template type and assert: dev-server validation passes, `dev` script
  present (backend/frontend), `pack` script present, `@checkstack/scripts`
  in devDependencies.

  In addition, the new `dev-internals.ts`, `dev-lifecycle.ts`,
  `dev-deps-resolver.ts`, and refactored `dev-frontend.ts` ship 58
  unit tests covering arg parsing, package.json validation, backend
  entry resolution, frontend-spawn decision, child env construction,
  the debounce watcher, the spawn → restart → shutdown lifecycle (with
  hard-kill SIGKILL fallback), the dev-auth service, and the bundle
  sibling resolver — all driven through injectable seams so no real
  process / Postgres / Vite is needed at test time.

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.
