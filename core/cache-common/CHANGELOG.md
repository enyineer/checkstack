- 2e20792: Declare `sideEffects` (CSS-only) so bundlers can tree-shake these packages' barrel exports

  These packages now declare `"sideEffects": ["**/*.css"]` in their
  `package.json`. This lets a consuming bundle drop unused barrel re-exports
  instead of pulling a whole package's component graph when only one
  provider/hook is imported (e.g. importing `SessionProvider` no longer dragged an
  admin form). It is build metadata only - no runtime behavior change.

- 56e7c75: Fix frontend access checks to use FULLY-QUALIFIED access-rule ids, and resolve
  the anonymous role on the frontend.

  Granted access-rule ids are stored fully-qualified as `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` (e.g.
  `incident.incident.read`) so two plugins defining the same short rule id never
  collide. The frontend, however, was checking the UNqualified id (`incident.read`)
  via `isAccessRuleSatisfied`, so every check failed for any user without the `*`
  (admin) grant - masked in development because dev-auth grants `*`. This silently
  broke ALL non-admin frontend gating (route guards, sidebar entries, and
  `useAccess`-based button/link gating).

  - **`@checkstack/common`**: `AccessRule` now carries a REQUIRED owning `pluginId`;
    `access()` / `accessPair()` require and stamp it; `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
    qualifies the rule (`{pluginId}.{id}`, plus the manage->read escalation) and
    matches ONLY the qualified form. There is intentionally NO unqualified fallback
    - matching a bare id would let one plugin's grant satisfy another plugin's
      identically-named rule (a cross-plugin privilege-escalation flaw). Every plugin
      that defines access rules now passes its own `pluginId`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend`**: `pluginManager.getAllAccessRules()` no longer strips
    the `pluginId` field (the rule `id` is already fully-qualified for the DB sync).
  - **Route guard** (`@checkstack/frontend` / `@checkstack/frontend-api`) now
    checks the FULL rule object (so it qualifies and escalates), not a bare id.
  - **Anonymous role on the frontend**: the `accessRules` procedure is now
    `public`, returning the configurable anonymous role's grants to unauthenticated
    callers; `useAccessRules` fetches them for guests instead of returning an empty
    set. So anonymous UI now reflects exactly what the anonymous role is allowed -
    which an admin can change (`isPublic` is only the seeded default).
  - Incident / maintenance / SLO detail routes are now read-gated (their read rule
    is an `isPublic` default, so the anonymous role holds it unless an admin
    revokes it); their dashboard status signals carry that rule and render as a
    link only when the viewer may open it.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/common`):** `AccessRule.pluginId` is now REQUIRED, and
  `access()` / `accessPair()` require a `pluginId` option. `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
  matches ONLY the fully-qualified `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` form - the previous
  unqualified fallback is removed, because it was a cross-plugin
  privilege-escalation flaw. Any code constructing an `AccessRule` or calling
  `access()`/`accessPair()` must supply the owning `pluginId`.

  Verified live against an anonymous caller: read pages resolve (qualified match),
  manage actions are denied, manage->read escalation and `*` still work.

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

### Minor Changes

- 9016526: Add a `/rest/:pluginId/*` HTTP mount that serves every plugin's oRPC contract
  through the REST/OpenAPI shape described by `/api/openapi.json`. Queries are
  `GET` with query parameters, mutations are `POST` with the input as the raw
  JSON body. The existing `/api/:pluginId/*` mount continues to serve oRPC's
  native wire protocol unchanged, so existing clients are not affected.

  The OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json` now reflects the real mount: every
  `paths` entry is prefixed with `/rest` instead of `/api`.

  Also fixes a SPA-fallback bug: the backend's `/api-docs` route previously
  returned 404 on production deployments because the static-file middleware
  skipped any path starting with `/api`, capturing `/api-docs` along with real
  API routes. The skip now requires a trailing slash (`/api/`, `/rest/`).

  Required access rules are now visible in the API Docs UI. The OpenAPI spec
  generator was reading a non-existent `accessRules` field on procedure
  metadata; the real field is `access: AccessRule[]`. Each procedure's access
  rules are now flattened to fully-qualified IDs (e.g. `catalog.system.read`)
  and emitted under `x-orpc-meta.accessRules`, which the existing
  `Required Access Rules` section in the docs UI already knew how to render.

  The API Docs schema renderer now handles record types (zod `z.record`),
  `$ref`s into `components.schemas`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, nullable union
  types (`type: ["string", "null"]`), and `format` qualifiers. Previously
  record outputs like `{ statuses: object }` masked the actual value type;
  they now render as `{ [key]: <ResolvedType> { ... } }` with the inner
  schema expanded, capped at 12 levels with cycle detection.

  **REST method conventions.** `proc()` now defaults to `GET` for queries and
  `POST` for mutations on the `/rest` mount, using bracket-notation query
  params (`?filter[status]=active&ids[0]=a`) for GET inputs. Existing
  procedures were updated to follow REST semantics:

  - `update*` mutations → `PATCH`
  - `delete*` / `remove*` mutations → `DELETE`
  - `getBulk*` queries and any query taking a large array input → `POST`
    (because `@orpc/openapi@1.13.x` has no GET→POST URL-length fallback)

  GET endpoints require an `object` input — bare scalars like
  `.input(z.string())` are not valid on GET. `getSystemConfigurations` was
  refactored from `.input(z.string())` to `.input(z.object({ systemId: ... }))`
  to fit the GET shape; the only call-site update was the in-process router
  unpacking `input.systemId` instead of passing `input` directly.

  The API Docs UI now renders query parameters (path/query/header/cookie) in a
  dedicated table for GET endpoints, and the fetch example shows them in the
  URL with `<required>` / `<optional>` placeholders.

### Minor Changes

- aa89bc5: Replace the bespoke `registerInfrastructureTab()` registry with a standard
  slot-extension contract (`InfrastructureTabsSlot` from
  `@checkstack/infrastructure-common`). Plugins now contribute infrastructure
  tabs via `createSlotExtension`, depending only on the slot owner.

  The slot system in `@checkstack/frontend-api` gains a second type parameter
  on `createSlot<TContext, TMetadata>` so extensions can declare typed static
  metadata at registration time (label, icon, access rules, ordering for the
  infrastructure tab bar). A new `useSlotExtensions(slot)` hook returns typed
  extensions and subscribes to plugin lifecycle changes.

  Each tab body now stacks a **Runtime** sub-section (live state, read-only)
  on top of a **Configuration** sub-section (settings, gated by `canUpdate`).

  **Queue runtime panel.** Surfaces aggregated counts (pending / processing /
  completed / failed) plus three sub-tabs of recent jobs: **Active**, **Recent
  failed** (with the failure message), and **Recent completed** (with
  duration). Job payloads are deliberately not surfaced — they may carry
  secrets and need a separate manage-access gate to be shown.

  To support this, `Queue<T>` gains a required `listJobs(opts)` method
  returning `JobSummary[]` (no payloads), and `QueueStats` gains a
  `scope: "instance" | "cluster"` field. The in-memory queue keeps rolling
  ring buffers (200 entries) for completed/failed history and tracks active
  jobs by id; BullMQ uses native `getJobs`. `QueueManager.listJobs` aggregates
  across queues and sorts (most-recent-first for terminal states, FIFO for
  active/waiting/delayed).

  **Cache runtime panel.** Lists the top N entries by size (or by recency) so
  operators can debug a cache filling up. Values are deliberately omitted —
  PII / secret risk. Backends opt in via an optional `listEntries?` method on
  `CacheProvider`; non-supporting backends return `{ supported: false }` and
  the UI renders a "not supported by this backend" hint. The in-memory cache
  implements it using its existing per-entry byte tracking.

  `CacheStats` also gains `scope: "instance" | "cluster"`.

  **Multi-instance scope warning.** A new `<InstanceScopeBanner>` component in
  `@checkstack/ui` renders a yellow banner above any runtime panel whose
  backend reports `scope: "instance"` — i.e. in-memory queue or cache running
  in a horizontally scaled deployment. The banner explains the metrics are
  local to the responding replica and recommends switching to a clustered
  backend (Redis-backed queue / cache) for cluster-wide visibility.

  **Bug fix — stable cache provider proxy.** `CacheManagerImpl.getProvider()`
  now returns a single stable proxy that delegates to whatever provider is
  currently active. Previously, consumers of `createCachedScope` (and any
  direct `cacheManager.getProvider()` caller) captured the active provider
  reference at plugin-init time. After any `setActiveBackend` call — including
  saving the same memory config in the new Cache tab, which reconstructs the
  in-memory cache — those scopes wrote to an orphaned old provider while the
  runtime panel read stats from the new (empty) one, making the runtime panel
  appear to report 0 keys. With the proxy, all consumers share a single stable
  identity and writes always land in the active provider.

  **Bytes tracking on the in-memory cache.** `InMemoryCache.getStats().sizeBytes`
  now returns a running approximation (UTF-8 bytes of the key plus
  `v8.serialize(value).byteLength`, with a JSON fallback) that's kept in sync
  across all eviction paths. Treat the number as a sanity gauge; it doesn't
  include `Map` per-entry overhead.

  **Pagination.** Both `Queue<T>.listJobs` and `CacheProvider.listEntries?`
  are offset-paginated. Inputs gain an `offset: number`; outputs change to
  `{ items, total: number | null, hasMore: boolean }`. `total` is nullable
  so backends that can't compute it cheaply still paginate via `hasMore`.
  The UI uses the existing `<Pagination>` component with a 25-row default
  page size. `QueueManager.listJobs` aggregates by over-fetching
  `[0, offset+limit)` per queue, merge-sorting, then slicing the window —
  optimal for the single-queue case, acceptable for the multi-queue case
  within the UI's reasonable page-depth bounds. BullMQ uses native offset
  ranges via `getJobs(types, start, end)` plus `getJobCounts` for `total`.

  **Pending tab.** The Queue runtime panel exposes a virtual `"pending"`
  state (waiting ∪ delayed, FIFO). It's now the default sub-tab, since
  "what's queued up?" is the most common question. Per-row state is shown
  when viewing the combined list.

  **Recurring schedules visible under Pending.** Cron- and interval-based
  recurring jobs (e.g. healthchecks) are surfaced under Pending/Delayed
  between fires, with a `nextRunAt` countdown column and a "(recurring)"
  label. `JobSummary` gains optional `nextRunAt: Date` and `recurring:
boolean` fields. The in-memory queue synthesises these rows from its
  `recurringJobs` registry; BullMQ already materialises the next fire of
  each scheduler as a delayed job and we now surface its trigger time and
  the `repeatJobKey`-derived `recurring` flag.

  **Bug fix — drop hook emits with no listeners.** `EventBus.emit` no
  longer enqueues a job when zero listeners (distributed or instance-local)
  are registered for the hook. Previously, hooks like
  `core.plugin.initialized` — emitted on every plugin init but subscribed
  to by nothing in the core repo — accumulated one waiting job per emit
  forever. The in-memory queue's `processNext` short-circuits when there
  are zero consumer groups, so its post-loop cleanup never ran for these
  orphaned jobs. The fix drops the emit at the source and logs a debug
  line. Note: in distributed deployments using a Redis-backed queue, this
  means a subscriber on another replica won't receive an event if no
  replica that emits it has a local listener. Plugins needing cross-process
  delivery must register their listener on every replica that should
  receive the hook.

  **Breaking notes (treated as minor under beta semantics)**:

  - `@checkstack/infrastructure-common` removes `registerInfrastructureTab`
    and `getInfrastructureTabs`; former callers must register an extension
    into `InfrastructureTabsSlot`.
  - `@checkstack/queue-api`'s `Queue<T>` interface requires the new
    `listJobs(opts)` method returning `ListJobsResult` (paginated). Both
    bundled queue backends (memory, BullMQ) are updated; out-of-tree
    implementations will need to add it.
  - `QueueStats` and `CacheStats` add a required `scope` field.
  - `CacheProvider.listEntries?` (when implemented) now returns
    `ListEntriesResult` instead of `CacheEntrySummary[]`.
  - `JobState` adds a `"pending"` variant.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: ## Infrastructure Configuration Shell & Cache System

  ### New Packages

  - **`@checkstack/cache-api`**: Core cache abstractions — `CacheProvider` interface, `createScopedCache` factory for plugin key isolation, `CachePlugin`/`CacheManager` lifecycle interfaces.
  - **`@checkstack/cache-common`**: Shared cache types, RPC contract (`getPlugins`, `getConfiguration`, `updateConfiguration`), access rules, and plugin metadata.
  - **`@checkstack/cache-backend`**: Cache settings RPC router — exposes plugin discovery, configuration read/write endpoints with access-gated authorization.
  - **`@checkstack/cache-frontend`**: Cache configuration tab component for the Infrastructure Settings page.
  - **`@checkstack/infrastructure-common`**: Infrastructure tab registry, routes, and shared types for the IDE-style configuration shell.
  - **`@checkstack/infrastructure-frontend`**: Infrastructure Settings page with vertical tab bar, per-tab access control, and user menu integration.

  ### Modified Packages

  - **`@checkstack/backend-api`**: Added `cachePluginRegistry` and `cacheManager` to `RpcContext` and `coreServices`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend`**: Registered cache services in boot sequence, added cache config loading, extended dependency sorter for cache plugin ordering.
  - **`@checkstack/queue-frontend`**: Refactored from standalone `/queue/config` route to an infrastructure tab. Queue settings now live inside the Infrastructure Settings page.

  ### Architecture

  The former monolithic Queue Config page is replaced by a pluggable Infrastructure Settings shell (`/infrastructure/config`). Plugins register configuration tabs via `registerInfrastructureTab()` with their own access rules, icons, and components. The shell evaluates per-tab access and only renders tabs the user can see.
