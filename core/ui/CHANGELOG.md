# @checkstack/ui

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: Added Categorical Anomaly Detection (Dominance Drift) support for non-numeric healthcheck values, and introduced Slider UI components for sensitivity and confirmation window anomaly settings.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8d1ef12]
  - @checkstack/common@0.7.0
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.11

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- c4e7560: Fix data integrity, cache invalidation, and mobile UI issues

  - **Centralized mutation cache invalidation**: Every mutation now automatically invalidates its plugin's query cache on success via the shared `createProcedureHook` in `orpc-query.tsx`. This ensures all views stay in sync without requiring individual components to remember manual `invalidateQueries` calls.
  - **Fixed oRPC query key matching**: Query keys use nested arrays (`[["pluginId"]]`) to correctly match oRPC's `[pathArray, options]` key structure. Fixed the broken flat-string pattern in `SystemBadgeDataProvider`.
  - **Fixed hourly aggregation duplication**: Added `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` to the `health_check_aggregates` unique constraint so local runs (`source_id = NULL`) correctly conflict-match instead of creating duplicate hourly buckets. Includes a migration to clean up existing duplicates.
  - **Fixed modal scrolling on mobile**: Added `max-height` + `overflow-y-auto` to `ConfirmationModal`, and refactored `Dialog` from translate-centering to flex-centering with `dvh` units for reliable mobile scroll containment.

- Updated dependencies [c4e7560]
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.10

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3da7582: Fix favicon not loading in production container and add NotFound page

  - **Backend**: Fix static file serving so root-level files like `/favicon.svg` are served from the dist directory before the SPA fallback catches them
  - **UI**: Add `NotFound` component with stacked-checkmark logo, physics-inspired falling "4" animation, and low-power device fallback
  - **Frontend**: Add catch-all `*` route to display the NotFound page for unmatched routes, and add the Checkstack logo to the navbar
  - **Favicon**: Redesign with stacked checkmarks in the brand purple/indigo palette

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- bb1fea0: Redesign system detail page with hero banner, two-column layout, plugin metric tiles, and health check slide-over drawer.

  ### New Components

  - **MetricTile** (`@checkstack/ui`): Compact stat tile with icon, label, value, variant coloring
  - **Sheet** (`@checkstack/ui`): Slide-over drawer built on Radix Dialog primitives

  ### New Extension Slot

  - **SystemOverviewMetricsSlot** (`@checkstack/catalog-common`): Plugin-contributed at-a-glance metric tiles in the system detail hero banner

  ### Layout Changes

  - System detail page now uses a hero banner with breadcrumb, status badges, and metric tile strip
  - Two-column layout: monitoring content (left) and system context (right)
  - Health checks rendered as compact card rows instead of heavy accordions
  - Clicking a health check opens a slide-over drawer with summary tiles, timeline charts, and recent runs
  - Right column uses lightweight borderless sections with dividers instead of heavy Card wrappers

  ### Plugin Extensions

  - Health check, SLO, Incident, and Maintenance plugins each contribute a metric tile to the hero banner

### Patch Changes

- bb1fea0: feat: implement active incident and maintenance overview sheets on dashboard

  - Replaces direct routing on status cards with slide-out overview sheets to gracefully degrade for users without manage permissions
  - Refactors dashboard system groups into a clean table-style list layout for better density
  - Makes global status cards more compact

## 1.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 4b0934d: Refactored UserMenu to use a responsive grid layout, improved menu item alignment, and implemented a full-screen scrollable portal for mobile devices. Fixed an issue where the UserMenu would instantly close and reopen when clicking the trigger while the menu was open.

## 1.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 286491a: Added automatic FPS detection that enables "Low Power Mode" once for devices running below 50 FPS, ensuring smooth performance even for users unaware of the manual toggle.

## 1.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 692c717: Increased the brightness and color intensity of the AmbientBackground auroras to ensure high visibility through the 1px grid lines.

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 594eecc: Implemented a manual "Low Power Mode" toggle in the user menu, allowing users to explicitly disable expensive visual effects. This replaces the previous automatic performance diagnostics with a more predictable, user-controlled system that persists to localStorage while still respecting OS-level "Reduced Motion" settings.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 0388000: Implemented a global performance-aware UI infrastructure that detects hardware capabilities (using heuristics and frame-budget benchmarks) to automatically disable expensive CSS animations, backdrop-blurs, and glassmorphism effects on low-power or non-hardware-accelerated devices.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 765b764: Optimize AmbientBackground performance by replacing thousand-div grid with a single-element CSS mask and hardware-accelerated Aurora Mesh animations.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 26d8bae: Distributed satellite health checks and Assignment IDE page

  **Satellite System**

  - New `satellite-backend`, `satellite-common`, `satellite-frontend`, and `satellite` agent packages for distributed health check execution
  - WebSocket-based satellite connectivity with authentication, heartbeats, and live configuration push
  - Satellite management UI with create dialog, status badges, and list page

  **Live Configuration Updates**

  - Added `assignmentChanged` hook to `healthcheck-backend` for cross-plugin communication
  - `satellite-backend` subscribes to assignment changes and pushes config updates to connected satellites in real-time

  **Assignment IDE Page**

  - Replaced the 1028-line modal-based `SystemHealthCheckAssignment` component with a full-page IDE layout
  - New modular components: `AssignmentTree`, `GeneralPanel`, `ThresholdsPanel`, `RetentionPanel`, `ExecutionPanel`
  - Added unassign capability and sorted assignment lists for stable ordering

  **Shared IDE Primitives**

  - Extracted `IDETreeNode`, `IDETreeSection`, `IDEStatusBar`, `IDELayout` to `@checkstack/ui` for cross-plugin reuse
  - Migrated existing health check IDE editor to use shared primitives

  **Infrastructure**

  - Added `Dockerfile.satellite` for containerized satellite deployment
  - WebSocket route registry in `@checkstack/backend` and `@checkstack/backend-api`

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- d1a2796: Enforce stricter code quality standards and eliminate AI slop anti-patterns.

  **New utility**

  - `extractErrorMessage(error, fallback?)` in `@checkstack/common` for consistent error extraction

  **ESLint rules**

  - `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps` for hook correctness
  - `no-console` in frontend packages — forces `toast` over silent `console.error`
  - `no-restricted-syntax` banning `instanceof Error` — forces `extractErrorMessage`
  - Custom `no-eslint-disable-any` rule preventing `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` circumvention

  **Refactoring**

  - Replace 141 `instanceof Error` boilerplate patterns across the codebase
  - Replace swallowed `console.error` with user-visible `toast.error()` feedback
  - Remove 15 redundant `as` type casts in IntegrationsPage and ProviderConnectionsPage
  - Consolidate 3 identical callback handlers into `handleDialogClose`
  - Fix conditional React hook call in `FormField.tsx`
  - Fix unstable useMemo deps in `Dashboard.tsx`
  - Replace `useEffect`→`setState` with derived `useMemo` in `RegisterPage.tsx`
  - Rewrite `keystore.test.ts` with typed `DrizzleMockChain` (eliminating 7 `any` suppressions)
  - Delete obvious comments in `encryption.ts` and Teams `provider.ts`

- Updated dependencies [d1a2796]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.5
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.9

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 23c80bc: ### Jira Data Center Support

  Added support for on-premise Jira Data Center installations alongside existing Jira Cloud support:

  - **Authentication mode switching**: New `authMode` field (`cloud` | `datacenter`) on connection configuration. Cloud uses Basic Auth (email + API token), Data Center uses Bearer Auth (Personal Access Token).
  - **API version routing**: Automatically selects REST API v3 for Cloud and v2 for Data Center.
  - **Description format**: Cloud uses Atlassian Document Format (ADF), Data Center uses plain text.
  - **Connection schema v2**: Backward-compatible — defaults to `cloud` mode for existing connections.

  ### DynamicForm `x-hidden-when` Conditional Visibility

  New generic platform feature for conditionally hiding form fields based on sibling field values:

  - Added `x-hidden-when` metadata extension to `ConfigMeta` and `JsonSchemaProperty`.
  - DynamicForm automatically hides fields and skips their validation when conditions match.
  - Used by Jira integration to hide the email field when `authMode` is `datacenter`.

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 95aa716: Fix LDAP CA certificate input: The custom CA certificate field was rendered as a single-line password input, which stripped newlines from PEM certificates and caused TLS connection failures ("Failed to connect"). The field now renders as a multi-line secret textarea that properly preserves PEM format while still encrypting the value in storage.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- c0c0ed2: Fix LDAP group-to-role mapping not assigning roles on login. The LDAP search now explicitly requests the `memberOf` operational attribute, which is not returned by default. Also fixes array flattening that discarded multi-valued group memberships, and adds case-insensitive DN comparison for group matching. The test LDAP environment now uses `groupOfUniqueNames` to enable the memberOf overlay. Additionally, the DynamicForm validation no longer blocks saving when optional array fields (like group mappings) are empty.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 6c743d4: Resolve AJV version mismatch and update to 8.18.0 for security reasons. Also fixed a TypeScript error in the HealthCheck latency chart caused by the Recharts v3 API change.
- Updated dependencies [67158e2]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.4
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.8

- 8d2660d: Added `@testing-library/react` to devDependencies.
- Updated dependencies [0ebbe56]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.3
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.6

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c842373: ## Animated Numbers & Availability Stats Live Updates

  ### Features

  - **AnimatedNumber component** (`@checkstack/ui`): New reusable component that displays numbers with a smooth "rolling" animation when values change. Uses `requestAnimationFrame` with eased interpolation for a polished effect.
  - **useAnimatedNumber hook** (`@checkstack/ui`): Underlying hook for the animation logic, can be used directly for custom implementations.
  - **Live availability updates**: Availability stats (31-day and 365-day) now automatically refresh when new health check runs are received via signals.

  ### Usage

  ```tsx
  import { AnimatedNumber } from "@checkstack/ui";

  <AnimatedNumber
    value={99.95}
    suffix="%"
    decimals={2}
    duration={500}
    className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500"
  />;
  ```

  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.5

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- e5079e1: Add contacts management to system editor

  - **catalog-frontend**: New `ContactsEditor` component allows adding/removing platform users and external mailboxes as system contacts directly from the system editor dialog
  - **catalog-common**: Added `instanceAccess` override to contacts RPC endpoints for correct single-resource RLAC checking
  - **ui**: Fixed Tabs component to use `type="button"` to prevent form submission when used inside forms

- 9551fd7: Fix creator display in incident and maintenance status updates

  - Show the creator's profile name instead of UUID in status updates
  - For maintenances, now properly displays the creator name (was missing)
  - For incidents, replaces UUID with human-readable profile name
  - System-generated updates (automatic maintenance transitions) show no creator

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

- Updated dependencies [0b9fc58]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.1
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.4

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 090143b: ### Health Check Aggregation & UI Fixes

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Fixed tail-end bucket truncation where the last aggregated bucket was cut off at the interval boundary instead of extending to the query end date
  - Added `rangeEnd` parameter to `reaggregateBuckets()` to properly extend the last bucket
  - Fixed cross-tier merge logic (`mergeTieredBuckets`) to prevent hourly aggregates from blocking fresh raw data

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `bucketEnd` field to `AggregatedBucketBaseSchema` so frontends know the actual end time of each bucket

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Updated all components to use `bucket.bucketEnd` instead of calculating from `bucketIntervalSeconds`
  - Fixed aggregation mode detection: changed `>` to `>=` so 7-day queries use aggregated data when `rawRetentionDays` is 7
  - Added ref-based memoization in `useHealthCheckData` to prevent layout shift during signal-triggered refetches
  - Exposed `isFetching` state to show loading spinner during background refetches
  - Added debounced custom date range with Apply button to prevent fetching on every field change
  - Added validation preventing start date >= end date in custom ranges
  - Added sparkline downsampling: when there are 60+ data points, they are aggregated into buckets with informative tooltips

  **UI (`ui`):**

  - Fixed `DateRangeFilter` presets to use true sliding windows (removed `startOfDay` from 7-day and 30-day ranges)
  - Added `disabled` prop to `DateRangeFilter` and `DateTimePicker` components
  - Added `onCustomChange` prop to `DateRangeFilter` for debounced custom date handling
  - Improved layout: custom date pickers now inline with preset buttons on desktop
  - Added responsive mobile layout: date pickers stack vertically with down arrow
  - Added validation error display for invalid date ranges

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

  **PageLayout Icons:**

  - Added required `icon` prop to `PageLayout` and `PageHeader` components that accepts a Lucide icon component reference
  - Icons are rendered with consistent `h-6 w-6 text-primary` styling
  - Updated all page components to include appropriate icons in their headers

  **Mobile Layout Improvements:**

  - Standardized responsive padding in main app shell (`p-3` on mobile, `p-6` on desktop)
  - Added `CardHeaderRow` component for mobile-safe card headers with proper wrapping
  - Improved `DateRangeFilter` responsive behavior with vertical stacking on mobile
  - Migrated pages to use `PageLayout` for consistent responsive behavior

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 538e45d: Fixed 24-hour date range not returning correct data and improved chart display

  - Fixed missing `endDate` parameter in raw data queries causing data to extend beyond selected time range
  - Fixed incorrect 24-hour date calculation using `setHours()` - now uses `date-fns` `subHours()` for correct date math
  - Refactored `DateRangePreset` from string union to enum for improved type safety and IDE support
  - Exported `getPresetRange` function for reuse across components
  - Changed chart x-axis domain from `["auto", "auto"]` to `["dataMin", "dataMax"]` to remove padding gaps

- Updated dependencies [db1f56f]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.0
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.3

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d1324e6: Enhanced DateTimePicker with calendar popup and independent field editing

  - Added calendar popup using `react-day-picker` and Radix Popover for date selection
  - Implemented independent input fields for day, month, year, hour, and minute
  - Added input validation with proper clamping on blur (respects leap years)
  - Updated `onChange` signature to `Date | undefined` to handle invalid states

  - BullMQ backend uses native cron scheduling via `pattern` option
  - InMemoryQueue implements wall-clock cron scheduling with `cron-parser`

  ### Maintenance Backend

  - Auto status transitions now use cron pattern `* * * * *` for precise second-0 scheduling
  - User notifications are now sent for auto-started and auto-completed maintenances
  - Refactored to call `addUpdate` RPC for status changes, centralizing hook/signal/notification logic

  ### UI

  - DateTimePicker now resets seconds and milliseconds to 0 when time is changed

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8a87cd4]
  - @checkstack/common@0.5.0
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.2

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 83557c7: ## CodeEditor Multi-Language Support

  - **Refactored CodeEditor** into modular architecture with language-specific support
  - **Added language modes**: JSON, YAML, XML, and Markdown with custom indentation and syntax highlighting
  - **Smart Enter key behavior**: Bracket/tag splitting (e.g., `<div></div>` → proper split on Enter)
  - **Autocomplete fix**: Enter key now correctly selects completions instead of inserting newlines
  - **Click area fix**: Entire editor area is now clickable (per official CodeMirror minHeight docs)
  - **Line numbers**: Now visible with proper gutter styling
  - **185 comprehensive tests** for all language indentation and template position validation

- 6dbfab8: Replace react-simple-code-editor with @uiw/react-codemirror for better maintenance and features. Added new `CodeEditor` component as a reusable abstraction for code editing with syntax highlighting.

### Patch Changes

- d316128: Add "None" option to optional Select fields in DynamicForm

  **Bug Fix:**

  - Optional select fields (using `x-options-resolver` or enums) now display a "None" option at the top of the dropdown
  - Selecting "None" clears the field value, allowing users to unset previously selected values
  - This fixes the issue where optional fields like `defaultRole` in authentication strategies could not be cleared after selection

- Updated dependencies [83557c7]
  - @checkstack/common@0.4.0
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.1

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- d94121b: Add group-to-role mapping for SAML and LDAP authentication

  **Features:**

  - SAML and LDAP users can now be automatically assigned Checkstack roles based on their directory group memberships
  - Configure group mappings in the authentication strategy settings with dynamic role dropdowns
  - Managed role sync: roles configured in mappings are fully synchronized (added when user gains group, removed when user leaves group)
  - Unmanaged roles (manually assigned, not in any mapping) are preserved during sync
  - Optional default role for all users from a directory

  **Bug Fix:**

  - Fixed `x-options-resolver` not working for fields inside arrays with `.default([])` in DynamicForm schemas

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- f6464a2: Fix theme toggle showing incorrect state when system theme is used

  - Added `resolvedTheme` property to `ThemeProvider` that returns the actual computed theme ("light" or "dark"), resolving "system" to the user's OS preference
  - Updated `NavbarThemeToggle` and `ThemeToggleMenuItem` to use `resolvedTheme` instead of `theme` for determining toggle state
  - Changed default theme from "light" to "system" so non-logged-in users respect their OS color scheme preference

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4eed42d]
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.3.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

- Updated dependencies [7a23261]
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9faec1f]
- Updated dependencies [f533141]
  - @checkstack/common@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.1.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Button component defaults to type="button"

  The `Button` component now defaults to `type="button"` instead of the HTML default `type="submit"`. This prevents accidental form submissions when buttons are placed inside forms but aren't intended to submit.

  ## Changes

  - Default `type` prop is now `"button"` instead of the HTML implicit `"submit"`
  - Form submission buttons must now explicitly set `type="submit"`

  ## Migration

  No migration needed if your submit buttons already have `type="submit"` explicitly set (recommended practice). If you have buttons that should submit forms but don't have an explicit type, add `type="submit"`:

  ```diff
  - <Button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</Button>
  + <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 97c5a6b: Fixed DOM clobbering issue in DynamicForm by prefixing field IDs with 'field-'. Previously, schema fields with names matching native DOM properties (like 'nodeName', 'tagName', 'innerHTML') could shadow those properties, causing floating-ui and React to crash during DOM traversal.
- Updated dependencies [8e43507]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.0.4

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- f5b1f49: Extended DynamicForm type definitions with additional JSON Schema metadata properties.
- Updated dependencies [f5b1f49]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.3
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.0.3

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- cb82e4d: Improved `counter` and `pie` auto-chart types to show frequency distributions instead of just the latest value. Both chart types now count occurrences of each unique value across all runs/buckets, making them more intuitive for visualizing data like HTTP status codes.

  Changed HTTP health check chart annotations: `statusCode` now uses `pie` chart (distribution view), `contentType` now uses `counter` chart (frequency count).

  Fixed scrollbar hopping when health check signals update the accordion content. All charts now update silently without layout shift or loading state flicker.

  Refactored health check visualization architecture:

  - `HealthCheckStatusTimeline` and `HealthCheckLatencyChart` now accept `HealthCheckDiagramSlotContext` directly, handling data transformation internally
  - `HealthCheckDiagram` refactored to accept context from parent, ensuring all visualizations share the same data source and update together on signals
  - `HealthCheckSystemOverview` simplified to use `useHealthCheckData` hook for consolidated data fetching with automatic signal-driven refresh

  Added `silentRefetch()` method to `usePagination` hook for background data refreshes without showing loading indicators.

  Fixed `useSignal` hook to use a ref pattern internally, preventing stale closure issues. Callbacks now always access the latest values without requiring manual memoization or refs in consumer components.

  Added signal handling to `useHealthCheckData` hook for automatic chart refresh when health check runs complete.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- d20d274: Initial release of all @checkstack packages. Rebranded from Checkmate to Checkstack with new npm organization @checkstack and domain checkstack.dev.
- Updated dependencies [d20d274]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.2
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.0.2

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 52231ef: # Auth Settings Page Refactoring

  ## Auth Frontend

  Refactored the `AuthSettingsPage` into modular, self-contained tab components:

  - **New Components**: Created `UsersTab`, `RolesTab`, `StrategiesTab`, and `ApplicationsTab` components
  - **Dynamic Tab Visibility**: Tabs are now conditionally shown based on user permissions
  - **Auto-Select Logic**: Automatically selects the first available tab if the current tab becomes inaccessible
  - **Self-Contained State**: Each tab component manages its own state, handlers, and dialogs, reducing prop drilling

  ## UI Package

  - **Responsive Tabs**: Tabs now use column layout on small screens and row layout on medium+ screens

- b0124ef: Fix light mode contrast for semantic color tokens

  Updated the theme system to use a two-tier pattern for semantic colors:

  - Base tokens (`text-destructive`, `text-success`, etc.) are used for text on light backgrounds (`bg-{color}/10`)
  - Foreground tokens (`text-destructive-foreground`, etc.) are now white/contrasting and used for text on solid backgrounds

  This fixes poor contrast issues with components like the "Incident" badge which had dark red text on a bright red background in light mode.

  Components updated: Alert, InfoBanner, HealthBadge, Badge, PermissionDenied, SystemDetailPage

- 54cc787: ### Fix Access Denied Flash on Page Load

  Fixed the "Access Denied" screen briefly flashing when loading permission-protected pages.

  **Root cause:** The `usePermissions` hook was setting `loading: false` when the session was still pending, causing a brief moment where permissions appeared to be denied.

  **Changes:**

  - `usePermissions` hook now waits for session to finish loading (`isPending`) before determining permission state
  - `PageLayout` component now treats `loading=undefined` with `allowed=false` as a loading state
  - `AuthSettingsPage` now explicitly waits for permission hooks to finish loading before checking access

  **Result:** Pages show a loading spinner until permissions are fully resolved, eliminating the flash.

- a65e002: Add compile-time type safety for Lucide icon names

  - Add `LucideIconName` type and `lucideIconSchema` Zod schema to `@checkstack/common`
  - Update backend interfaces (`AuthStrategy`, `NotificationStrategy`, `IntegrationProvider`, `CommandDefinition`) to use `LucideIconName`
  - Update RPC contracts to use `lucideIconSchema` for proper type inference across RPC boundaries
  - Simplify `SocialProviderButton` to use `DynamicIcon` directly (removes 30+ lines of pascalCase conversion)
  - Replace static `iconMap` in `SearchDialog` with `DynamicIcon` for dynamic icon rendering
  - Add fallback handling in `DynamicIcon` when icon name isn't found
  - Fix legacy kebab-case icon names to PascalCase: `mail`→`Mail`, `send`→`Send`, `github`→`Github`, `key-round`→`KeyRound`, `network`→`Network`, `AlertCircle`→`CircleAlert`

### Minor Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.

### Patch Changes

- eff5b4e: Add standalone maintenance scheduling plugin

  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-common` package with Zod schemas, permissions, oRPC contract, and extension slots
  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-backend` package with Drizzle schema, service, and oRPC router
  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-frontend` package with admin page and system detail panel
  - Shared `DateTimePicker` component added to `@checkstack/ui`
  - Database migrations for maintenances, maintenance_systems, and maintenance_updates tables
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.0.2
