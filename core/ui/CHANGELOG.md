### Patch Changes

- 52231ef: # Auth Settings Page Refactoring

  ## Auth Frontend

  Refactored the `AuthSettingsPage` into modular, self-contained tab components:

  - **New Components**: Created `UsersTab`, `RolesTab`, `StrategiesTab`, and `ApplicationsTab` components
  - **Dynamic Tab Visibility**: Tabs are now conditionally shown based on user permissions
  - **Auto-Select Logic**: Automatically selects the first available tab if the current tab becomes inaccessible
  - **Self-Contained State**: Each tab component manages its own state, handlers, and dialogs, reducing prop drilling

  ## UI Package

  - **Responsive Tabs**: Tabs now use column layout on small screens and row layout on medium+ screens

- b0124ef: Fix light mode contrast for semantic color tokens

  Updated the theme system to use a two-tier pattern for semantic colors:

  - Base tokens (`text-destructive`, `text-success`, etc.) are used for text on light backgrounds (`bg-{color}/10`)
  - Foreground tokens (`text-destructive-foreground`, etc.) are now white/contrasting and used for text on solid backgrounds

  This fixes poor contrast issues with components like the "Incident" badge which had dark red text on a bright red background in light mode.

  Components updated: Alert, InfoBanner, HealthBadge, Badge, PermissionDenied, SystemDetailPage

- 54cc787: ### Fix Access Denied Flash on Page Load

  Fixed the "Access Denied" screen briefly flashing when loading permission-protected pages.

  **Root cause:** The `usePermissions` hook was setting `loading: false` when the session was still pending, causing a brief moment where permissions appeared to be denied.

  **Changes:**

  - `usePermissions` hook now waits for session to finish loading (`isPending`) before determining permission state
  - `PageLayout` component now treats `loading=undefined` with `allowed=false` as a loading state
  - `AuthSettingsPage` now explicitly waits for permission hooks to finish loading before checking access

  **Result:** Pages show a loading spinner until permissions are fully resolved, eliminating the flash.

- a65e002: Add compile-time type safety for Lucide icon names

  - Add `LucideIconName` type and `lucideIconSchema` Zod schema to `@checkstack/common`
  - Update backend interfaces (`AuthStrategy`, `NotificationStrategy`, `IntegrationProvider`, `CommandDefinition`) to use `LucideIconName`
  - Update RPC contracts to use `lucideIconSchema` for proper type inference across RPC boundaries
  - Simplify `SocialProviderButton` to use `DynamicIcon` directly (removes 30+ lines of pascalCase conversion)
  - Replace static `iconMap` in `SearchDialog` with `DynamicIcon` for dynamic icon rendering
  - Add fallback handling in `DynamicIcon` when icon name isn't found
  - Fix legacy kebab-case icon names to PascalCase: `mail`→`Mail`, `send`→`Send`, `github`→`Github`, `key-round`→`KeyRound`, `network`→`Network`, `AlertCircle`→`CircleAlert`

### Minor Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.

### Patch Changes

- eff5b4e: Add standalone maintenance scheduling plugin

  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-common` package with Zod schemas, permissions, oRPC contract, and extension slots
  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-backend` package with Drizzle schema, service, and oRPC router
  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-frontend` package with admin page and system detail panel
  - Shared `DateTimePicker` component added to `@checkstack/ui`
  - Database migrations for maintenances, maintenance_systems, and maintenance_updates tables
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.0.2
