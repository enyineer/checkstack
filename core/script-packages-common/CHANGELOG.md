# @checkstack/script-packages-common

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 270ef29: Fix several correctness defects around distributed coordination and stored-data handling.

  - Dwell `for:` timers now fire via an atomic `DELETE ... RETURNING` claim, so two pods (or the stalled sweeper vs the queue consumer) can no longer both fire the same dwell.
  - Postgres session-level advisory locks now keep connection affinity. A shared `AdvisoryLockService` (backed by a dedicated pooled client) replaces the previous acquire/release-on-different-connection pattern that leaked locks. Used by the script-packages installer election, the automation run resume + stalled sweeper, and (via a new transaction-scoped `withXactLock`) incident dedup.
  - A storage migration that crashed mid-flight is now resumed on startup under the installer-election lock, instead of permanently wedging installs.
  - Distributed script-package blobs carry a `blobSha256` and are verified before extraction (the SRI `integrity` hashes the npm tarball, not the transported archive). Backward-safe: entries without the field skip verification until a re-install regenerates the manifest.
  - Archive extraction rejects zip-slip paths (absolute or `..` entries) before writing anything.
  - `incident.create` with `dedupe_open_for_system` serializes its check-then-create per system, so concurrent triggers for the same system can't both open a duplicate incident.
  - Seeded auto-incident filter expressions JSON-encode interpolated ids so a quote/backslash can't corrupt the expression.
  - Stored jsonb snapshots (dwell `actorSnapshot`, wait-lock `waitConfig`) are validated with zod on load and degrade safely instead of flowing through as the wrong type.

- 270ef29: Core-side satellite script-package distribution.

  - `satellite-backend`: the WS handler now carries the desired script-package
    lockfile hash in `authenticated` / `config_updated` payloads (the durable
    backstop), exposes `pushRefreshScriptPackagesToAll` (wired to the
    `script-packages.changed` broadcast hook in `mode: "broadcast"`, so each
    core instance fans the refresh out to its own connected satellites), and
    persists `script_package_sync_state` reports from satellites.
  - `script-packages-*`: new `reportSatelliteSyncState` RPC + store method so
    satellite-backend can record per-satellite reconcile state for the admin
    UI. Satellites pull blobs from core via the existing `getManifest` /
    `downloadBlob` endpoints, never the registry.

- 270ef29: Add the script-packages common package: zod schemas (package allowlist
  spec, registry config, lockfile manifest, install / storage / migration
  state, per-host sync state, package types, size-cap config), the oRPC
  contract, frontend signal + `script-packages.changed` hook id/payload,
  the dedicated `script-packages.manage` and `script-packages.read` access
  rules, and plugin metadata.
- 270ef29: Add garbage collection for script packages, reclaiming both shared blob storage and per-host disk.

  Two things accumulated and were never reclaimed; both are now collected with provably-safe guards (referenced-set + grace + lock / active-run protection - when in doubt, retain).

  - **Blob GC (Postgres / S3 reclamation).** A new `gcBlobs` RPC (manage-gated) plus a daily scheduled job prune content-addressed blobs no longer referenced by any retained lockfile manifest (the current desired hash plus the previous N, default 1, for rollback / in-flight reconciles). Candidates are only deleted after a grace window (default 24h, keyed on `created_at`), each blob's bytes are removed from its recorded backend before its index row, and the pass holds the installer-election advisory lock so it is mutually exclusive with installs and storage migrations. The settings UI surfaces last-run and total-reclaimed figures and a "Run cleanup now" action. The installer now records each successful manifest in a new `script_package_lockfile_history` table so the retained set is computable; GC state lives in `script_package_blob_gc_state`.
  - **Tree GC (per-host disk).** After a successful symlink flip, each host (core pod or satellite) sweeps its `trees/<lockfileHash>/` dirs, deleting non-current trees older than a grace window (default 1h). `current`'s target is never deleted. Active-run safety uses a conservative mtime-keyed grace window chosen to exceed the longest run timeout, since runs are throwaway subprocesses with no robust cross-process refcount - a tree only becomes eligible once no live run could still be pinned to it.

  Adds the `gcBlobs` / `getBlobGcState` RPCs, the `BlobGcSummary` / `BlobGcState` schemas, and two new Drizzle tables (`script_package_lockfile_history`, `script_package_blob_gc_state`).

- b995afb: Fix package IntelliSense in script editors: lazy Automatic Type Acquisition (ATA) with proper `@types/*` resolution.

  Script editors (automation "Run Script (TypeScript)" and healthcheck collectors) now provide real autocomplete for installed npm packages. Importing a package whose types live in DefinitelyTyped - e.g. `import { debounce } from "lodash"` (lodash ships no own types; `@types/lodash` does) - now yields member completions. Previously no package completions appeared at all.

  Root cause: the old rollup wrapped each package's raw, multi-file `.d.ts` (with `export =`, `export as namespace`, and triple-slash `/// <reference path>` chains) inside a single `declare module "<name>" { ... }`, which the TypeScript worker silently rejected, and it truncated large type sets (lodash is ~866 KB across ~700 files) at a 256 KB cap.

  The fix registers the REAL declaration files at their `node_modules/...` virtual paths and lets TypeScript's own NodeJs + `@types` resolution do the work:

  - `@checkstack/script-packages-backend`: replaced `rollupPackageTypes` with a tree-driven closure extractor (`resolvePackageTypeClosure`). Given a bare specifier, it resolves against the materialized tree - own types via `package.json` `types`/`typings`/`exports` (bundled-types packages like `zod`/`dayjs`), the `@types/<mangled>` companion when it exists (`lodash` -> `@types/lodash`, scoped `@babel/core` -> `@types/babel__core`), or both, or neither (graceful empty, never a throw). It follows `/// <reference path|types>` and relative imports, includes each package's `package.json`, leaves every file UNWRAPPED, and surfaces a `truncated` flag instead of silently capping. Served from a new raw, HTTP-cacheable route `GET /api/script-packages/types/:lockfileHash/:specifier` (`Cache-Control: private, max-age=1y, immutable`), auth-gated by `script-packages.read`.
  - `@checkstack/script-packages-common`: **BREAKING** - replaced the `listPackageTypes` RPC procedure and `PackageTypesSchema { name, version, dts }` with `PackageTypeClosureSchema` (a `{ path, content }` file-map plus `hasOwnTypes`/`hasAtTypes`/`notFound`/`truncated`) served over the cacheable HTTP route. Added a shared `buildTypeAcquisitionPath`/`parseTypeAcquisitionPath` path contract.
  - `@checkstack/ui`: `CodeEditor`/`TypefoxEditor` gained an injected `acquireTypes` resolver + `acquireResetKey`. On debounced buffer change it parses bare `import`/`require` specifiers (pure, unit-tested) and lazily fetches + registers each NEW package's closure via `addExtraLib` at `file:///node_modules/...`, deduped by a shared acquired-set that resets when the install hash changes. Compiler options set `moduleResolution: NodeJs`, `baseUrl: "file:///"`, and `typeRoots` so a bare import resolves to its `@types` companion. The `context` ambient global keeps working unchanged.
  - `@checkstack/script-packages-frontend`: replaced the old `useScriptPackageTypes` (which concatenated the broken `dts`) with `useScriptPackageTypeAcquisition()`, returning the `acquireTypes` resolver (targets the cacheable route, zod-validates the response) and the current `lockfileHash` as `acquireResetKey`.
  - `@checkstack/automation-frontend` / `@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`: wired the resolver into the Run Script and collector editors.

  State & scale: the type closure is derived on read from the materialized package tree (no new durable state). The editor's acquired-set is pod-local UI bookkeeping; the route is keyed by the cluster-wide `lockfileHash`, so the browser HTTP cache is correct across pods and only refetches after a new install changes the hash.

- b995afb: Add live, backend-proxied npm package-name autocomplete and version lookup to the Script Packages "Allowed packages" form.

  The package-name field now searches the configured registry as you type (debounced). The version field suggests the package's published versions newest-first, defaulting to the registry's `latest` dist-tag while staying free-typeable for an exact manual pin. Picking a package now auto-fills its version (from the search hit, then upgraded to `latest`) instead of clearing the field, and the version dropdown stays open so a version is actually selectable.

  This is fully backend-proxied so it reuses the SAME configured registry + auth the install path uses: the registry can be private with a server-side-only auth token (the client only ever sees `hasAuthToken`), and browsers can't reach arbitrary registries due to CORS.

  - `@checkstack/script-packages-common`: two new `manage`-gated query procedures - `searchPackages` (input `{ text }`, output `{ items: [{ name, version?, description? }] }`) and `getPackageVersions` (input `{ name }`, output `{ versions, distTags? }`). Output `version`/`versions` are relaxed to plain strings so valid-but-unusual registry versions surface as suggestions; strict `PackageVersionSchema` validation still applies on `addPackage`.
  - `@checkstack/script-packages-backend`: new `registry-client` (fetch-based, AbortController timeout, size cap, zod-validated registry responses, scoped-registry selection, tolerant semver-descending sort, a best-effort pod-local read cache that is never a source of truth, and errors that never leak the auth token). Search results use the registry's own relevance ranking from `-/v1/search`. The registry + token resolution used by the install path is factored into a shared `resolveRegistryRequestConfig` helper reused by both the new RPC handlers and the installer.
  - `@checkstack/script-packages-frontend`: the package and version inputs become live comboboxes (Popover + Input) with inline pinned-version validation before "Add" is enabled. Selecting a suggestion routes through a dedicated `onSelect(hit)` callback (separate from manual-typing `onValueChange`) so a pick auto-fills the version instead of clearing it; the popover dismissable layer ignores interactions originating on the anchor input, fixing the version dropdown that previously opened then immediately closed. The version-autofill decision logic is extracted into a pure, unit-tested helper.

  State & scale: the registry-client TTL cache is an explicitly non-authoritative, pod-local best-effort read cache (search/version lookups are non-authoritative reads); a cache miss on another pod simply re-fetches, so pod-local divergence is harmless. No new durable state of record is introduced.

- 270ef29: Wire up the script-packages RPC router, admin UI, and editor IntelliSense.

  - `script-packages-backend`: the oRPC router implementing the full
    contract (allowlist CRUD, registry config with encrypted write-only auth
    token, `installNow` via the elected installer, size cap, storage backend
    selection, install state, `getManifest` / `downloadBlob` for reconcilers,
    and `listPackageTypes`), the `installNow` controller (election, size-cap
    enforcement, `script-packages.changed` emit, blocked during migration),
    the `.d.ts` rollup, the singleton config stores, and the full plugin
    wiring (broadcast-hook reconcile + startup backstop).
  - `script-packages-common`: admin route for the settings page.
  - `script-packages-frontend`: the Settings -> Script Packages admin page
    (allowlist, install state + size, registry/storage summary, satellite
    sync) and the `useScriptPackageTypes()` hook.
  - `automation-frontend` / `healthcheck-frontend`: merge installed-package
    `.d.ts` into the script-editor `typeDefinitions` so `import` from an
    allowlisted package autocompletes in every script field.

- 270ef29: Add storage-backend migration for script packages.

  - `migrateStorage({ target })` copies every blob from the active backend to
    the target, verifies each copy byte-for-byte (read back + SHA-256 compare),
    flips the per-blob `backend` only after a verified copy, then atomically
    switches the active backend. Resumable from a partial state (the work set
    is re-derived from the index), aborts cleanly on an integrity mismatch
    (active backend untouched), and supports optional source GC. Built on the
    Phase 2 dual-backend read fallback, so reads keep working mid-migration.
  - Migration and `installNow` are mutually exclusive via the installer
    advisory lock; `setStorageBackend` is refused while a migration runs.
  - New `listStorageBackends` RPC + admin UI: a storage-backend card with a
    target selector, "Migrate" action, and live progress / completion / error
    state.
