### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Plugin-owned AI tools: every domain plugin contributes its own AI tools (chat assistant + automation AI action), and `ai-backend` is platform-only.

  Every plugin-specific AI tool is owned by the plugin whose domain it acts on, registered via that plugin's own `aiToolExtensionPoint` / `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint` from its init - the same path an external plugin author uses. `ai-backend` no longer imports or depends on any capability plugin's `*-common`; the dependency direction is strictly plugin -> ai-platform. Pure helpers (`computeFieldDiff`, capability-summary, `ScriptContextKind`) live in `@checkstack/ai-common`.

  Tools shipped:

  - Health checks and automations: full CRUD - `healthcheck.propose` / `automation.propose` and `*.update` (`mutate`, deep-validated) and `*.delete` (`destructive`, always confirm-gated). `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run calls the new deep `validateConfiguration` so propose-time validation matches apply-time. Assertions are validated against the collector's result schema and the canonical operator vocabulary. Capability-catalog tools (`ai.listCapabilities`, `ai.getCapabilitySchema`), script context tools (`ai.getScriptContext`, `ai.testScript`), and notify-subscriber tools (`healthcheck.notifySystemSubscribers` / `...GroupSubscribers`).
  - Catalog: `catalog.createSystem` / `updateSystem` / `createGroup` / `updateGroup` (`mutate`), `catalog.deleteSystem` / `deleteGroup` (`destructive`), membership tools (`mutate`), plus `catalog.listSystems` / `listGroups` read projections.
  - Incident: `incident.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `resolve` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `incident.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `incident.get` / `incident.list` read projections.
  - Maintenance: `maintenance.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `close` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `maintenance.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `maintenance.list` / `get` read projections.
  - Read projections for SLO (`slo.listObjectives`), dependency (`dependency.list`), incident (`incident.list`), healthcheck (`healthcheck.status`), and anomaly (`anomaly.explain`), each gated by the source procedure's own access rule and routed as the principal.
  - Documentation grounding: `ai.searchDocs` / `ai.getDoc` over a build-time bundled docs index (BM25-ish ranking), so the assistant grounds how-to answers in Checkstack's own docs offline.
  - URL introspection: `ai.probeUrl`, an SSRF-guarded read tool the assistant uses to inspect a real endpoint before drafting a health check. Update tools compute a before -> after field diff rendered on the confirm card (approve mode) or an "Applied" card (auto mode), so a change is never silent.

  `ai_analyze` automation action (automation-backend, with an editor connection picker + audited tool calls): runs a bounded AI agent on the run context as the automation's `runAs` service account, so it can never exceed that identity's permissions; destructive tools are never offered; mutating tools auto-apply through the service account's client. Produces an `automation.analysis` artifact downstream actions can branch on. The agent loop is exposed as a headless `aiAgentRunnerRef` service so automation-backend can drive it without depending on ai-backend.

  `notification.notifyForSubscription` is now callable by user / application principals holding `notification.send` (previously service-only). Every tool routes through the user-scoped client, so handler-side authorization is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC action; the resolver gate plus the propose/apply re-check at propose AND apply are the additional authority. A systemic authz regression test asserts every registered tool falls into exactly one safe authorization category.

  A new `ai_transport` enum value `automation` records the AI action's tool calls in the `ai_tool_calls` audit log. No new durable state beyond that; each tool is a thin, deterministic wrapper over an existing RPC, so every pod behaves identically.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Add environments as a first-class catalog primitive, with per-environment health-check fan-out, config templating, per-environment reactive health, and script run-context exposure.

  - Catalog primitive: an environment is a sibling of groups - a named, instance-global record carrying free-form custom fields (baseUrl, region, tier, ...) that any system can belong to many-to-many. New `environments` + `systems_environments` tables, `EnvironmentSchema` + create/update schemas, `EntityService` environment CRUD and membership joins, RPC endpoints gated by a new `catalogAccess.environment` access rule, a GitOps `Environment` kind + `System.environments` extension, and frontend management (an `EnvironmentEditor`, an Environments management panel, and a per-system environment picker). The Environments card's Add/Edit/Delete affordances are gated on `catalogAccess.environment.manage`.
  - Per-environment fan-out: run identity becomes `(systemId, configurationId, environmentId)`. Runs, aggregates, and state transitions gain a nullable `environmentId`. The health-check assignment gains an `environmentIds` selector with three modes (All / Specific / None; `null` and `[]` are distinct). The queue executor resolves the effective environment set via the catalog `resolveSystemEnvironments` read and executes one isolated run per environment.
  - Config templating: a new `x-templatable` config-field marker renders a string field through the template engine at execute time, against `{ environment, check, system }`. A shared `renderTemplatableConfig` and a `renderTemplatePreview` helper (re-exported from `@checkstack/template-engine`) keep editor previews identical to the run-time render. The HTTP collector's `url`, `headers[].value`, and `body` are templatable, rendered per environment (the strategy client build moves inside the per-env loop); the `url`'s `.url()` validation moves post-render. Secrets resolve before templating; a field marked both secret and `x-templatable` is rejected at plugin load. `DynamicForm` shows a live "Preview" line, and the catalog `EnvironmentPreviewPicker` ("Preview as: <environment>") drives it in the collector editor (only when the schema has a templatable field).
  - Script run-context: `CollectorRunContext` gains an optional `environment` field (`{ id, name, fields }`, metadata only). Shell collectors receive `CHECKSTACK_ENV_ID` / `_NAME` / `CHECKSTACK_ENV_<FIELD>` vars; inline TS collectors read `globalThis.context.environment`; the editor test panel mirrors both. The env-less path is unchanged.
  - Per-environment reactive health (see BREAKING below), env-keyed read/write paths, env-qualified serialization locks, an optional `trigger.payload.environmentId`, per-environment isolation, and an `ENVIRONMENT_RESOLUTION_FAILED` signal when catalog resolution degrades to a single env-less run.

  BREAKING CHANGES: the reactive `health` entity's id-shape and cardinality change. It now encodes two views: per-environment (id `"<systemId>::<environmentId>"`) and a system rollup (id `"<systemId>"`, the worst status across environments + env-less runs). The rollup PRESERVES the pre-existing system-level contract - dashboards, status badges, and automations referencing health by `systemId` keep working without re-authoring - but the entity's contract surface changed (new id-shape, higher cardinality, new payload field), so it is flagged breaking. `getBulkHealthState` parses env-qualified ids and keys results by the original id.

  State and scale: membership and custom fields live only in catalog Postgres and are re-read every tick via the cross-plugin RPC; env-keyed health reads from shared `health_check_runs` / aggregates / transitions (compute-on-read). Every pod resolves the same effective set and the same per-environment health. No pod-local environment state.

  Also: `unwrapSchema` in `zod-config.ts` loops instead of single-pass-stripping so multi-layer wrappers (`.optional().default()`) still resolve `x-templatable` meta. The env-less `{{ environment.* }}` run notice logs at `debug` (a legitimate recurring configuration), while the post-render HTTP `.url()` check still fails a genuinely-broken empty render with a clear "Rendered URL is invalid" error.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Add a deep `validateConfiguration` RPC to the health-check plugin so propose-time validation matches apply-time validation.

  - `validateConfiguration` (`@checkstack/healthcheck-common`): a new mutation procedure gated by `healthcheck.healthcheck.manage`, taking a proposed configuration (reusing the create skeleton) and returning `{ valid, errors: [{ path, message }] }`, mirroring automation's `validateDefinition`. It persists nothing.
  - Shared deep validation (`@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`): `collectConfigurationIssues` resolves strategy + collectors by fully-qualified id then migrate-then-validate-strict each config via `parseStrictAssumingV1`. The GitOps reconcile path is refactored to call the same `validateVersionedConfigStrict`, so create / gitops-apply / the new RPC share one implementation.
  - `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run (`@checkstack/ai-backend`) now calls `validateConfiguration` as its validation authority, so a wrong config type or a typo'd key surfaces at propose time, bringing it to the same deep-validate level `automation.propose` already has.

  State and scale: no durable state; `validateConfiguration` is a pure read against the in-process registries plus zod validation, identical on every pod.

  This is a beta minor.

### Patch Changes

- 9dcc848: Input-validation and error-mapping hardening found by a fuzzing pass against the built container.

  - backend: a Postgres driver error caused by bad client input no longer surfaces as a `500`. The `/api` and `/rest` dispatchers now map the relevant SQLSTATE classes to the correct status - `22P02`/`22003`/`22001`/`22007` (malformed/out-of-range/over-long/bad-date value), `23502`/`23503`/`23514` (missing/dangling/check-failed) to `400`, and `23505` (unique violation) to `409` - and log them at `warn` (client mistake), not `error`. The client-facing message is generic so column/constraint names are never leaked; genuine unknown faults still log at `error` and 500. Previously a `where id = $1` with a non-uuid `$1` (or an over-long string, or a foreign-key miss in `addSystemToGroup`) reached the driver and 500'd, making routine probing look like a server outage and burying real 500s.
  - slo-common: **fixes a stored cluster-wide DoS.** `windowDays` was accepted up to `2^53`, but the SLO engine derives window boundaries with `Date(now - windowDays * 86_400_000)` - a large value overflows past the max representable `Date` and yields `Invalid Date`. That objective committed fine, then every subsequent read of the system's objectives threw `RangeError: Invalid time value` during serialization (a 500 readable by anyone with SLO read access, on any pod). `windowDays` is now bounded to 1..3650 days at the contract, the GitOps `kind: SLO` spec, and the update path via a single shared `SloWindowDaysSchema`, so the poison row can never be created.
  - slo-common + healthcheck-common: SLO `getDailySnapshots` and the healthcheck history endpoints (`getHistory`, `getDetailedHistory`, `getAggregatedHistory`, `getDetailedAggregatedHistory`, `getRunsForAnalysis`) declared their `startDate`/`endDate` params as `z.date()`, which a `/rest/...` string param can never satisfy - so those endpoints 400'd on the entire REST surface. They now use `z.coerce.date()`, accepting both the REST string shape and the native RPC `Date`.
  - healthcheck-common: `intervalSeconds` was `z.number().min(1)` with no `.int()` and no upper bound, so a fractional or out-of-range value reached the DB and failed at insert (the column is a 32-bit int). It is now `.int().min(1).max(2_592_000)` (1 second .. 30 days), applied to both create and update (the update schema is the create partial).
  - catalog-common: system/group/environment names were bare `z.string()` (environment was `.min(1)` only), so empty, whitespace-only, and 100KB+ names reached the DB - the huge ones surfaced as 500s when parameter binding blew up. Names are now `trim().min(1).max(200)` via a shared schema.

    **BREAKING:** `getSystemContacts` is now `userType: "authenticated"` (was `"public"`). System contacts carry PII (user id, name, email); the public read leaked them to anonymous status-page visitors. Anonymous callers now receive `401` for this one endpoint; the system detail page already renders "No contacts assigned" for anonymous viewers, so the UI degrades gracefully. All other catalog reads remain public.

  - catalog-frontend: the system detail page skips the `getSystemContacts` request entirely for anonymous viewers (it would now `401`) and falls back to the empty state.

  This is a beta release: the breaking contact-visibility change ships as a minor bump per the beta versioning policy, not a major.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 270ef29: Add the health-state provider data contract (automation sensing layer, Wave 2 Phase 13).

  - New `health_check_state_transitions` table records every aggregate health-status transition for a system (all statuses, not just unhealthy), giving a reliable "in current status since" timestamp. Written wherever an aggregate transition is detected. Pruned with raw-run retention, but the single most-recent row per system is always kept so an active streak never blanks.
  - New service-typed RPCs on `HealthCheckApi`: `getHealthState({ systemId, configurationId? })` returns `{ status, inStatusSince, inStatusForMs, latencyMs?, avgLatencyMs?, p95LatencyMs?, successRate?, lastRunAt?, inMaintenance, evaluatedAt }`, and `getBulkHealthState({ systemIds })` (POST) resolves many systems against one shared timestamp.
  - New service-typed RPC on `MaintenanceApi`: `hasActiveMaintenance({ systemId })` reports whether a system is in an active maintenance window regardless of notification-suppression (suppression-agnostic), folded into `getHealthState` as `inMaintenance`.

  All reads are fail-safe: a missing transition row yields `inStatusSince: null`, and a maintenance-plugin error fails open to `inMaintenance: false`.

- 270ef29: Add a windowed transition count to the health provider - the building block for custom flapping rules (Wave 2 Phase 18).

  Flapping is already buildable today via the built-in `healthcheck.flapping_detected` trigger; this phase ships the GENERALIZATION for arbitrary "N status changes in M minutes" rules.

  - `countStateTransitionsInWindow` counts aggregate status transitions for a system over a trailing window (from the Phase 13 `health_check_state_transitions` table - all statuses, generalizing the unhealthy-only flapping detector). Fail-safe to 0.
  - `getHealthState` / `getBulkHealthState` now return `transitionsInWindow` + `transitionWindowMinutes`, and accept an optional `transitionWindowMinutes` input (default 60).
  - The automation definition gains an optional top-level `state_window_minutes` (default 60), threaded through `enrichScopeWithState` so `health.system.transitions_in_window` / `health.system.transition_window_minutes` are folded into scope per evaluation.
  - Operators author custom flapping as a `numeric_state` condition over `health.system.transitions_in_window` - no new condition variant, no editor change. The variable-scope resolver surfaces the new fields for autocomplete.

- 270ef29: Replace the hardcoded auto-incident path with default automations (Wave 2 Phase 20).

  BREAKING CHANGES: Auto-incident is now automation-driven. The hardcoded background path that opened incidents on sustained-unhealthy / flapping and closed them after a cooldown (`auto-incident.ts`, `auto-incident-close-job.ts`) is removed. On upgrade, an idempotent, threshold-preserving migration seeds equivalent default automations from each assignment's existing `NotificationPolicy`, so alerting behaviour is preserved 1:1:

  - `sustainedUnhealthyTrigger.durationMinutes` -> the `for:` dwell on a `healthcheck.system_degraded` trigger -> `incident.create`.
  - auto-close `autoCloseAfterMinutes` -> a `wait_until` (healthy continuously for the cooldown) -> `incident.resolve`.
  - `useNotificationSuppression` -> the incident's `suppressNotifications`.
  - `skipDuringMaintenance` -> a `{{ !health.system.in_maintenance }}` pre-run condition.
  - `flappingTrigger.{transitions,windowMinutes}` -> a second automation on the `healthcheck.flapping_detected` trigger -> `incident.create`.

  Auto-incidents remain ONE OPEN INCIDENT PER SYSTEM, faithful to the old behaviour. `incident.create` gains an opt-in `dedupe_open_for_system` config flag (default false, so existing/custom automations are unaffected): when true, it reuses an existing open incident on the target system instead of opening a duplicate (the old `findActiveAutoIncident(systemId)` semantic), returning the reused incident as the produced `incident` artifact. The seeded default automations set this flag, so a system with several failing checks - sustained and/or flapping - still gets a single open incident; whichever check crosses its threshold first opens it, and the rest dedupe to it. Both sustained and flapping default automations open at `critical` severity (parity with the old path). Per-system run dedup within an automation uses `concurrency_scope: "context_key"` + `mode: "single"`.

  Operators can read, edit, disable, and extend these automations (see the "Customise auto-incident" guide). Seeded automations are tagged via `managedBy` (`auto-incident:<systemId>:<configurationId>:<kind>`) so the migration is a no-op on re-runs; anything unmappable is recorded as a migration-failure row.

  Flapping DETECTION (transition recording + the `healthcheck.flapping_detected` emit) is relocated into `flapping-detector.ts` and survives; the emit now fires unconditionally on a threshold cross (no longer gated on `autoOpenIncidentOnUnhealthy`), matching the hook's documented intent and required for the flapping default automation. The legacy `health_check_auto_incidents` mapping table is no longer written or read (it will be dropped in a follow-up migration); `health_check_unhealthy_transitions` is retained for the flapping detector.

  New service-typed `HealthCheckApi.listAutoIncidentPolicies` RPC exposes each assignment's effective notification policy for the migration. `incident.create` adds the `dedupe_open_for_system` flag (additive, defaults off).

- b995afb: Move health-check flapping configuration from the per-assignment notification policy onto the `healthcheck.flapping_detected` automation trigger.

  Flapping thresholds (`transitions`, `windowMinutes`) are now configured on the trigger itself, next to the automation that reacts to them, instead of on each check assignment. The health-check executor still owns the windowed transition counting (it writes `health_check_unhealthy_transitions` and runs the window query), but it now SOURCES the thresholds from the subscribed automations' trigger config:

  - On a transition-to-unhealthy it records the transition unconditionally (keeping history warm), then looks up the enabled automations subscribed to `healthcheck.flapping_detected`, collects the distinct set of configured windows, counts transitions once per distinct window, and emits one `healthcheck.flapping_detected` per window. The trigger's exact-window `evaluateConfig` gate then fires each automation only for its own window and transition threshold.
  - A missing or partial flapping trigger config defaults to `{ transitions: 3, windowMinutes: 60 }`, so automations created before the trigger carried config keep working unchanged.
  - `automation-backend` exposes a new backend-only, read-only `automationSubscriptionsRef` service ref (`findEnabledByTriggerEvent`) so a plugin that owns a trigger's underlying event can discover its subscribers' trigger config. It is never browser-exposed.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - The per-assignment `notificationPolicy.flappingTrigger` field is removed. `NotificationPolicy` is now `{ suppressDeEscalations }` only. Stored rows that still carry a `flappingTrigger` key parse cleanly - the key is stripped on read - so no data migration is required, but the per-check flapping toggle/threshold in the assignment Notifications tab is gone; configure flapping on the trigger instead.
  - The GitOps `System.healthcheck[].notificationPolicy.flappingTrigger` field is removed. A `flappingTrigger` block in a manifest is ignored. Move the thresholds to the `transitions` / `windowMinutes` config of your `healthcheck.flapping_detected` automation trigger.
  - The standalone `enabled` flag for flapping is gone: flapping is "enabled" precisely when at least one enabled automation subscribes to `healthcheck.flapping_detected`. With no subscriber, the transition is still recorded but nothing is counted or emitted.

- b995afb: Remove the legacy per-assignment auto-incident system. Auto-incidents are now built entirely by user-authored automations; nothing is seeded or hardcoded.

  What was removed:

  - The one-time migration that auto-seeded "sustained unhealthy" and "flapping" default automations from each assignment's notification policy, plus the `listAutoIncidentPolicies` RPC it consumed.
  - The seeder-only notification-policy settings and their UI: `autoOpenIncidentOnUnhealthy`, `useNotificationSuppression`, `skipDuringMaintenance`, `sustainedUnhealthyTrigger`, and `autoCloseAfterMinutes`. The assignment **Notifications** tab now exposes only the two live settings: **Suppress de-escalation notifications** and the **flapping-detection** thresholds.
  - The dead `health_check_auto_incidents` table (no longer written or read; dropped via migration).

  What is preserved: flapping detection (`healthcheck.flapping_detected`) and de-escalation suppression are unchanged. The `flappingTrigger` and `suppressDeEscalations` policy fields stay exactly as before.

  > [!NOTE]
  > One-time cleanup: an automation-backend migration deletes the historically auto-seeded incident automations (`managed_by LIKE 'auto-incident:%'`) from existing databases. This is intentional and destructive - those automations were no longer managed by anything. If you had edited a seeded automation and want to keep it, re-create it as a normal automation before upgrading. See the "Build auto-incident automations" guide for templates.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > NARROWING: `NotificationPolicySchema` is narrowed to `{ suppressDeEscalations, flappingTrigger }`. Stored rows that still carry the removed legacy keys parse cleanly - zod strips the unknown keys on read - so no data migration is required for the `system_health_checks.notification_policy` column. GitOps `notificationPolicy` specs that set the removed fields are no longer accepted for those keys.

- 270ef29: Extend in-UI script testing to health-check collectors, and add
  load-from-run replay for automation script tests.

  - Health-check collectors: a new `testCollectorScript` RPC runs the
    inline-script (TypeScript) collector and the shell `script` collector
    against an editable, auto-seeded sample context using the same
    sandboxed runner the real collector uses. Surfaces beneath the
    collector script fields in the collector editor (both marked
    `x-script-testable`). Gated by `healthcheck.configuration.manage`.
  - Automation replay: a new `getRunScopeForReplay` RPC reconstructs an
    editable test context from a real run (trigger + persisted artifacts,
    plus the durable scope snapshot when the run is still in-flight), and
    the script-test panel gains a "Load from run" picker that seeds the
    sample context from a past run.

  Note: health-check executions do not persist the script / config /
  check / system that produced a result, so there is no health-check
  replay - auto-seed is the only context source for collector tests. This
  is by design; see the feature plan.

- 270ef29: Secrets platform Phase 2: secret -> env-var mapping with central resolve, inject, and mask.

  - Script consumers declare a least-privilege `secretEnv` allowlist
    (`{ ENV_NAME: "${{ secrets.NAME }}" }`). The automation `run_script` /
    `run_shell` actions resolve ONLY the declared secrets via
    `secretResolverRef.resolveForRun`, inject them into the runner env for
    that run (memory-only; the ESM runner gained a per-run `env` option), and
    mask their values out of stdout/stderr/result/error via the run-scoped
    masking context. A missing required secret fails the run clearly. No
    ambient secret access.
  - Test panel: `testScript` / `testCollectorScript` inject named
    `__SECRET_<NAME>__` placeholders by default, or user-supplied per-secret
    overrides; real production values are never resolved in the test path,
    and overrides are masked out of the result.
  - Healthcheck collectors carry the `secretEnv` field for authoring +
    the test panel; runtime injection on satellites lands in Phase 3.
  - Editor UX: a new `@checkstack/ui` `SecretEnvEditor` renders `x-secret-env`
    record fields with `${{ secrets.* }}` name autocomplete (from
    `listSecretNames`), wired into the automation action editor and the
    healthcheck collector editor. New `withConfigMeta` helper +
    `x-secret-env` config-meta key in `@checkstack/backend-api`.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 35bc682: feat(healthcheck): expose check + system run-context to script collectors

  Script health checks can now read which check and system a run is for.
  Previously shell scripts got only a curated env whitelist and inline
  scripts only `context.config`, so a script had no built-in way to know
  its own check name or the system it was checking.

  - `@checkstack/backend-api`: new `CollectorRunContext` type
    (`{ check: { id, name, intervalSeconds }, system: { id, name } }`) and
    an optional `runContext` param on `CollectorStrategy.execute`. Optional,
    so existing collector implementations are unaffected.
  - Shell-script collector: injects reserved `CHECKSTACK_CHECK_ID`,
    `CHECKSTACK_CHECK_NAME`, `CHECKSTACK_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
    `CHECKSTACK_SYSTEM_ID`, `CHECKSTACK_SYSTEM_NAME` env vars (user-supplied
    `env` still wins on collision).
  - Inline-script collector: exposes `context.check` and `context.system`
    alongside `context.config`; the inline-script editor now types them for
    autocomplete.
  - Shell editors (health-check collectors and automation shell actions) now
    also suggest the user's own `env` (JSON) keys as `$NAME` completions, via
    the new exported `customShellEnvVars` helper. Keys that aren't valid shell
    identifiers are omitted.
  - Fix: the Typefox `CodeEditor` captured a stale `onChange` at editor start,
    so editing one `DynamicForm` field reverted sibling fields changed since
    mount (e.g. typing in a shell `script` field wiped an unsaved `env` value,
    or deleted a sibling automation action added after mount). The change
    handler now routes through a ref to the current `onChange`.
  - Fix: focusing a JSON editor threw "LanguageStatusService.addStatus is not
    supported" because the standalone service set omitted `ILanguageStatusService`.
    That one service is now registered via `serviceOverrides`.
  - Fix: the automation trigger card nested a `<Badge>` (a `<div>`) inside a
    `<p>`, producing a `validateDOMNesting` warning. Switched the wrapper to a
    `<div>`.
  - Local runs (`queue-executor`) and satellite runs both populate the
    context. `SatelliteAssignment` (and the `getAssignmentsForSatellite`
    RPC output) gained optional `configName` / `systemName` so the metadata
    reaches satellite-side execution; `HealthCheckService` resolves the
    system name via the catalog client.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `createHealthCheckRouter` now requires a `catalogClient`
  option (used to resolve system names for satellite assignments). Update
  call sites to pass the catalog RPC client.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ba07ae2: Quiet down notification spam on flapping systems, auto-open incidents when a check goes critical, and let operators land directly on the broken checks.

  Notification policy lives **per healthcheck assignment** (one row per `system × configuration`). Different checks on the same system are fully independent — disabling a setting on one check does not affect the others. Defaults preserve existing behaviour for `suppressDeEscalations`; **auto-incident defaults to on** for new and existing assignments.

  - **`suppressDeEscalations`** (off by default). When on, transitions from a worse state to a better-but-still-failing state (e.g. `unhealthy → degraded`) no longer fire a notification. Escalations and full recoveries to `healthy` are unaffected. Resolved per assignment (the just-ran check is the one driving any aggregate transition).
  - **`autoOpenIncidentOnUnhealthy`** (on by default). Either of two independent triggers can open the auto-incident:
    - **`sustainedUnhealthyTrigger`** (default 30 min) — opens when the check stays continuously unhealthy for the configured duration. Catches real outages.
    - **`flappingTrigger`** (default 3 transitions in 60 min) — opens when the check flips to unhealthy that many times in the window. Catches persistent flapping where each unhealthy phase is too brief for the sustained trigger.
      Each trigger can be individually disabled. One incident per system: triggering checks attach to an existing active auto-incident.
  - **`useNotificationSuppression`** (on by default, only meaningful when auto-open is on). Controls whether the auto-opened incident is created with `suppressNotifications: true` — leaving this off opens the incident but still pings operators on each transition.
  - **`skipDuringMaintenance`** (on by default). No auto-incident is opened while the system has an active maintenance window with suppression. The system is intentionally down and shouldn't trip the on-call.
  - **`autoCloseAfterMinutes`** (default 30). Auto-close cooldown is now per-assignment and snapshotted per-incident at open time — later policy edits don't alter in-flight incidents. Setting `null` ("Never auto-close") leaves the incident for manual resolution.
  - **Require-recovery rule.** After any auto-incident closes (manual or auto), no new auto-incident can open until the check has logged at least one healthy run. Prevents a "operator dismissed but it's still broken" loop.
  - **Auto-close worker** ticks every 60s and resolves auto-opened incidents whose systems have been healthy for their per-row `cooldownMinutes`. Rows with `null` cooldown are skipped entirely. Per-incident: failed close attempts are logged but never abort the sweep.
  - **`incidentResolved` hook subscriber** syncs the auto-incident mapping when an operator manually resolves the incident, so the require-recovery rule sees the close immediately.
  - **Platform-wide defaults.** New admin RPCs `getPlatformNotificationDefaults` / `setPlatformNotificationDefaults` (under the existing `healthcheck.configuration.{read,manage}` access rules) let operators set notification policy once for the whole instance. Per-assignment rows with `notificationPolicy: null` inherit the platform defaults at read time. UI: a "Notification defaults" button in the Assignment IDE opens a modal editor. The per-assignment Notifications panel shows an inheritance banner — "Using platform defaults" (read-only) with an "Override" button, or "Custom override" with a "Use platform defaults" button to revert. The all-or-nothing model keeps the mental model simple: each assignment is either fully inherited or fully overridden.
  - **New service-level RPCs** on the incident plugin (`createAutoIncident`, `resolveAutoIncident`) let other plugins open/close incidents without a user context. Reused by the healthcheck auto-incident flow.
  - **Health-state notification CTA** now deep-links to `?filter=failing` on the system detail page for non-recovery transitions (label changes to "View failing checks"). The system overview gains an `All / Failing / Healthy` segmented filter wired to the same `?filter=…` param.
  - **Notification bell badge** now counts collapse groups instead of raw rows, so the number matches what the user sees in the notifications list. Built on `COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(collapse_key, id))` — notifications without a collapse key still each count as one.
  - **`statusFilter` on `getHistory` / `getDetailedHistory`** lets the run-history page and the drawer's Recent Runs panel filter to `All / Healthy / Failing` via shared pills, with the page resetting to the first page on filter change.
  - **Pagination defaults aligned with selector options.** Several pages defaulted to a page size (5 or 20) that wasn't in the dropdown's options (`[10, 25, 50, 100]`), so the page-size `<Select>` rendered empty. The drawer's Recent Runs now defaults to 10; the Run History, History List, and Delivery Logs pages now default to 25.

  Includes Drizzle migrations adding the `notification_policy` jsonb column to `system_health_checks`, plus two new tables: `health_check_unhealthy_transitions` (for threshold counting) and `health_check_auto_incidents` (for mapping back to incident ids during auto-close).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9016526: Add a `/rest/:pluginId/*` HTTP mount that serves every plugin's oRPC contract
  through the REST/OpenAPI shape described by `/api/openapi.json`. Queries are
  `GET` with query parameters, mutations are `POST` with the input as the raw
  JSON body. The existing `/api/:pluginId/*` mount continues to serve oRPC's
  native wire protocol unchanged, so existing clients are not affected.

  The OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json` now reflects the real mount: every
  `paths` entry is prefixed with `/rest` instead of `/api`.

  Also fixes a SPA-fallback bug: the backend's `/api-docs` route previously
  returned 404 on production deployments because the static-file middleware
  skipped any path starting with `/api`, capturing `/api-docs` along with real
  API routes. The skip now requires a trailing slash (`/api/`, `/rest/`).

  Required access rules are now visible in the API Docs UI. The OpenAPI spec
  generator was reading a non-existent `accessRules` field on procedure
  metadata; the real field is `access: AccessRule[]`. Each procedure's access
  rules are now flattened to fully-qualified IDs (e.g. `catalog.system.read`)
  and emitted under `x-orpc-meta.accessRules`, which the existing
  `Required Access Rules` section in the docs UI already knew how to render.

  The API Docs schema renderer now handles record types (zod `z.record`),
  `$ref`s into `components.schemas`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, nullable union
  types (`type: ["string", "null"]`), and `format` qualifiers. Previously
  record outputs like `{ statuses: object }` masked the actual value type;
  they now render as `{ [key]: <ResolvedType> { ... } }` with the inner
  schema expanded, capped at 12 levels with cycle detection.

  **REST method conventions.** `proc()` now defaults to `GET` for queries and
  `POST` for mutations on the `/rest` mount, using bracket-notation query
  params (`?filter[status]=active&ids[0]=a`) for GET inputs. Existing
  procedures were updated to follow REST semantics:

  - `update*` mutations → `PATCH`
  - `delete*` / `remove*` mutations → `DELETE`
  - `getBulk*` queries and any query taking a large array input → `POST`
    (because `@orpc/openapi@1.13.x` has no GET→POST URL-length fallback)

  GET endpoints require an `object` input — bare scalars like
  `.input(z.string())` are not valid on GET. `getSystemConfigurations` was
  refactored from `.input(z.string())` to `.input(z.object({ systemId: ... }))`
  to fit the GET shape; the only call-site update was the in-process router
  unpacking `input.systemId` instead of passing `input` directly.

  The API Docs UI now renders query parameters (path/query/header/cookie) in a
  dedicated table for GET endpoints, and the fetch example shows them in the
  URL with `<required>` / `<optional>` placeholders.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: ## Downstream consumer bumps for the anomaly detection + cache system rollout

  Packages on this branch were updated as part of the anomaly detection feature (schema annotations on result fields, plugin metadata for the modular cache system) but were not listed in the upstream changesets.

  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-common`** (minor) — new RPC contract additions and schema changes supporting per-field anomaly metadata.
  - **`@checkstack/cache-memory-common`** (minor) — new package providing access rules + plugin metadata for the in-memory cache backend.
  - **healthcheck plugins** (patch) — adopt the new `x-anomaly-*` schema annotations on their result fields so anomaly detection works automatically against their checks. No public API changes.
  - **integration / notification / auth / queue / collector plugins** (patch) — minor internal updates as consumers of upstream API changes (cache plugin registry, schema additions). No public API changes.

  - Availability is calculated as `(healthyRuns / totalRuns) * 100`
  - Data is sourced from both daily aggregates and recent raw runs to include the most up-to-date information
  - Frontend displays availability stats with color-coded badges (green ≥99.9%, yellow ≥99%, red <99%)
  - Shows total run counts for each period

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f81b60: ### Clickable Run History with Deep Linking

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Added `getRunById` service method to fetch a single health check run by ID

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `getRunById` RPC procedure for fetching individual runs
  - Added `historyRun` route for deep linking to specific runs (`/history/:systemId/:configurationId/:runId`)

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Table rows in Recent Runs and Run History now navigate to detailed view instead of expanding inline
  - Added "Selected Run" card that displays when navigating to a specific run
  - Extracted `ExpandedResultView` into reusable component
  - Fixed layout shift during table pagination by preserving previous data while loading
  - Removed accordion expansion in favor of consistent navigation UX

### Patch Changes

- 090143b: ### Health Check Aggregation & UI Fixes

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Fixed tail-end bucket truncation where the last aggregated bucket was cut off at the interval boundary instead of extending to the query end date
  - Added `rangeEnd` parameter to `reaggregateBuckets()` to properly extend the last bucket
  - Fixed cross-tier merge logic (`mergeTieredBuckets`) to prevent hourly aggregates from blocking fresh raw data

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `bucketEnd` field to `AggregatedBucketBaseSchema` so frontends know the actual end time of each bucket

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Updated all components to use `bucket.bucketEnd` instead of calculating from `bucketIntervalSeconds`
  - Fixed aggregation mode detection: changed `>` to `>=` so 7-day queries use aggregated data when `rawRetentionDays` is 7
  - Added ref-based memoization in `useHealthCheckData` to prevent layout shift during signal-triggered refetches
  - Exposed `isFetching` state to show loading spinner during background refetches
  - Added debounced custom date range with Apply button to prevent fetching on every field change
  - Added validation preventing start date >= end date in custom ranges
  - Added sparkline downsampling: when there are 60+ data points, they are aggregated into buckets with informative tooltips

  **UI (`ui`):**

  - Fixed `DateRangeFilter` presets to use true sliding windows (removed `startOfDay` from 7-day and 30-day ranges)
  - Added `disabled` prop to `DateRangeFilter` and `DateTimePicker` components
  - Added `onCustomChange` prop to `DateRangeFilter` for debounced custom date handling
  - Improved layout: custom date pickers now inline with preset buttons on desktop
  - Added responsive mobile layout: date pickers stack vertically with down arrow
  - Added validation error display for invalid date ranges

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 11d2679: Add ability to pause health check configurations globally. When paused, health checks continue to be scheduled but execution is skipped for all systems using that configuration. Users with manage access can pause/resume from the Health Checks config page.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ac3a4cf: ### Dynamic Bucket Sizing for Health Check Visualization

  Implements industry-standard dynamic bucket sizing for health check data aggregation, following patterns from Grafana/VictoriaMetrics.

  **What changed:**

  - Replaced fixed `bucketSize: "hourly" | "daily" | "auto"` with dynamic `targetPoints` parameter (default: 500)
  - Bucket interval is now calculated as `(endDate - startDate) / targetPoints` with a minimum of 1 second
  - Added `bucketIntervalSeconds` to aggregated response and individual buckets
  - Updated chart components to use dynamic time formatting based on bucket interval

  **Why:**

  - A 24-hour view with 1-second health checks previously returned 86,400+ data points, causing lag
  - Now returns ~500 data points regardless of timeframe, ensuring consistent chart performance
  - Charts still preserve visual fidelity through proper aggregation

  **Breaking Change:**

  - `bucketSize` parameter removed from `getAggregatedHistory` and `getDetailedAggregatedHistory` endpoints
  - Use `targetPoints` instead (defaults to 500 if not specified)

  ***

  ### Collector Aggregated Charts Fix

  Fixed issue where collector auto-charts (like HTTP request response time charts) were not showing in aggregated data mode.

  **What changed:**

  - Added `aggregatedResultSchema` to `CollectorDtoSchema`
  - Backend now returns collector aggregated schemas via `getCollectors` endpoint
  - Frontend `useStrategySchemas` hook now merges collector aggregated schemas
  - Service now calls each collector's `aggregateResult()` when building buckets
  - Aggregated collector data stored in `aggregatedResult.collectors[uuid]`

  **Why:**

  - Previously only strategy-level aggregated results were computed
  - Collectors like HTTP Request Collector have their own `aggregateResult` method
  - Without calling these, fields like `avgResponseTimeMs` and `successRate` were missing from aggregated buckets

- db1f56f: Add ephemeral field stripping to reduce database storage for health checks

  - Added `x-ephemeral` metadata flag to `HealthResultMeta` for marking fields that should not be persisted
  - All health result factory functions (`healthResultString`, `healthResultNumber`, `healthResultBoolean`, `healthResultArray`, `healthResultJSONPath`) now accept `x-ephemeral`
  - Added `stripEphemeralFields()` utility to remove ephemeral fields before database storage
  - Integrated ephemeral field stripping into `queue-executor.ts` for all collector results
  - HTTP Request collector now explicitly marks `body` as ephemeral

  This significantly reduces database storage for health checks with large response bodies, while still allowing assertions to run against the full response at execution time.

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7a23261]
  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

- f533141: Enforce health result factory function usage via branded types

  - Added `healthResultSchema()` builder that enforces the use of factory functions at compile-time
  - Added `healthResultArray()` factory for array fields (e.g., DNS resolved values)
  - Added branded `HealthResultField<T>` type to mark schemas created by factory functions
  - Consolidated `ChartType` and `HealthResultMeta` into `@checkstack/common` as single source of truth
  - Updated all 12 health check strategies and 11 collectors to use `healthResultSchema()`
  - Using raw `z.number()` etc. inside `healthResultSchema()` now causes a TypeScript error

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9faec1f]
- Updated dependencies [f533141]
  - @checkstack/common@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

- 97c5a6b: Add UUID-based collector identification for better multiple collector support

  **Breaking Change**: Existing health check configurations with collectors need to be recreated.

  - Each collector instance now has a unique UUID assigned on creation
  - Collector results are stored under the UUID key with `_collectorId` and `_assertionFailed` metadata
  - Auto-charts correctly display separate charts for each collector instance
  - Charts are now grouped by collector instance with clear headings
  - Assertion status card shows pass/fail for each collector
  - Renamed "Success" to "HTTP Success" to clarify it's about HTTP request success
  - Fixed deletion of collectors not persisting to database
  - Fixed duplicate React key warnings in auto-chart grid

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8e43507]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.4

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f5b1f49: Extended health check system with per-collector assertion support.

  - Added `collectors` column to `healthCheckConfigurations` schema for storing collector configs
  - Updated queue-executor to run configured collectors and evaluate per-collector assertions
  - Added `CollectorAssertionSchema` to healthcheck-common for assertion validation
  - Results now stored with `metadata.collectors` containing per-collector result data

- f5b1f49: Added JSONPath assertions for response body validation and fully qualified strategy IDs.

  **JSONPath Assertions:**

  - Added `healthResultJSONPath()` factory in healthcheck-common for fields supporting JSONPath queries
  - Extended AssertionBuilder with jsonpath field type showing path input (e.g., `$.data.status`)
  - Added `jsonPath` field to `CollectorAssertionSchema` for persistence
  - HTTP Request collector body field now supports JSONPath assertions

  **Fully Qualified Strategy IDs:**

  - HealthCheckRegistry now uses scoped factories like CollectorRegistry
  - Strategies are stored with `pluginId.strategyId` format
  - Added `getStrategiesWithMeta()` method to HealthCheckRegistry interface
  - Router returns qualified IDs so frontend can correctly fetch collectors

  **UI Improvements:**

  - Save button disabled when collector configs have invalid required fields
  - Fixed nested button warning in CollectorList accordion

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f5b1f49]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.3
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.3

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- cb82e4d: Improved `counter` and `pie` auto-chart types to show frequency distributions instead of just the latest value. Both chart types now count occurrences of each unique value across all runs/buckets, making them more intuitive for visualizing data like HTTP status codes.

  Changed HTTP health check chart annotations: `statusCode` now uses `pie` chart (distribution view), `contentType` now uses `counter` chart (frequency count).

  Fixed scrollbar hopping when health check signals update the accordion content. All charts now update silently without layout shift or loading state flicker.

  Refactored health check visualization architecture:

  - `HealthCheckStatusTimeline` and `HealthCheckLatencyChart` now accept `HealthCheckDiagramSlotContext` directly, handling data transformation internally
  - `HealthCheckDiagram` refactored to accept context from parent, ensuring all visualizations share the same data source and update together on signals
  - `HealthCheckSystemOverview` simplified to use `useHealthCheckData` hook for consolidated data fetching with automatic signal-driven refresh

  Added `silentRefetch()` method to `usePagination` hook for background data refreshes without showing loading indicators.

  Fixed `useSignal` hook to use a ref pattern internally, preventing stale closure issues. Callbacks now always access the latest values without requiring manual memoization or refs in consumer components.

  Added signal handling to `useHealthCheckData` hook for automatic chart refresh when health check runs complete.

### Minor Changes

- 4dd644d: Enable external application (API key) access to management endpoints

  Changed `userType: "user"` to `userType: "authenticated"` for 52 endpoints across 5 packages, allowing external applications (service accounts with API keys) to call these endpoints programmatically while maintaining RBAC permission checks:

  - **incident-common**: createIncident, updateIncident, addUpdate, resolveIncident, deleteIncident
  - **maintenance-common**: createMaintenance, updateMaintenance, addUpdate, closeMaintenance, deleteMaintenance
  - **catalog-common**: System CRUD, Group CRUD, addSystemToGroup, removeSystemFromGroup
  - **healthcheck-common**: Configuration management, system associations, retention config, detailed history
  - **integration-common**: Subscription management, connection management, event discovery, delivery logs

  This enables automation use cases such as:

  - Creating incidents from external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - Scheduling maintenances from CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing catalog systems from infrastructure-as-code tools
  - Configuring health checks from deployment scripts

- ae19ff6: Add configurable state thresholds for health check evaluation

  **@checkstack/backend-api:**

  - `VersionedConfig<T>` now extends `VersionedData<T>` and adds `pluginId`
  - Added `migrateVersionedData()` utility function for running migrations on any `VersionedData` subtype

  **@checkstack/backend:**

  - Refactored `ConfigMigrationRunner` to use the new `migrateVersionedData` utility

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-common:**

  - Added state threshold schemas with two evaluation modes (consecutive, window)
  - Added `stateThresholds` field to `AssociateHealthCheckSchema`
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC endpoint contract

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-backend:**

  - Added `stateThresholds` column to `system_health_checks` table
  - Added `state-evaluator.ts` with health status evaluation logic
  - Added `state-thresholds-migrations.ts` with migration infrastructure
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC handler

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Updated `SystemHealthBadge` to use new backend endpoint

- 0babb9c: Add public health status access and detailed history for admins

  **Permission changes:**

  - Added `healthcheck.status.read` permission with `isPublicDefault: true` for anonymous access
  - `getSystemHealthStatus`, `getSystemHealthOverview`, and `getHistory` now public
  - `getHistory` no longer returns `result` field (security)

  **New features:**

  - Added `getDetailedHistory` endpoint with `healthcheck.manage` permission
  - New `/healthcheck/history` page showing paginated run history with expandable result JSON
