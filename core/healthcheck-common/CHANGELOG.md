# @checkstack/healthcheck-common

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

- Updated dependencies [0b9fc58]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.1
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.5

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d6f7449: Add availability statistics display to HealthCheckSystemOverview

  - New `getAvailabilityStats` RPC endpoint that calculates availability percentages for 31-day and 365-day periods
  - Availability is calculated as `(healthyRuns / totalRuns) * 100`
  - Data is sourced from both daily aggregates and recent raw runs to include the most up-to-date information
  - Frontend displays availability stats with color-coded badges (green ≥99.9%, yellow ≥99%, red <99%)
  - Shows total run counts for each period

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f81b60: ### Clickable Run History with Deep Linking

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Added `getRunById` service method to fetch a single health check run by ID

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `getRunById` RPC procedure for fetching individual runs
  - Added `historyRun` route for deep linking to specific runs (`/history/:systemId/:configurationId/:runId`)

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Table rows in Recent Runs and Run History now navigate to detailed view instead of expanding inline
  - Added "Selected Run" card that displays when navigating to a specific run
  - Extracted `ExpandedResultView` into reusable component
  - Fixed layout shift during table pagination by preserving previous data while loading
  - Removed accordion expansion in favor of consistent navigation UX

### Patch Changes

- 090143b: ### Health Check Aggregation & UI Fixes

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Fixed tail-end bucket truncation where the last aggregated bucket was cut off at the interval boundary instead of extending to the query end date
  - Added `rangeEnd` parameter to `reaggregateBuckets()` to properly extend the last bucket
  - Fixed cross-tier merge logic (`mergeTieredBuckets`) to prevent hourly aggregates from blocking fresh raw data

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `bucketEnd` field to `AggregatedBucketBaseSchema` so frontends know the actual end time of each bucket

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Updated all components to use `bucket.bucketEnd` instead of calculating from `bucketIntervalSeconds`
  - Fixed aggregation mode detection: changed `>` to `>=` so 7-day queries use aggregated data when `rawRetentionDays` is 7
  - Added ref-based memoization in `useHealthCheckData` to prevent layout shift during signal-triggered refetches
  - Exposed `isFetching` state to show loading spinner during background refetches
  - Added debounced custom date range with Apply button to prevent fetching on every field change
  - Added validation preventing start date >= end date in custom ranges
  - Added sparkline downsampling: when there are 60+ data points, they are aggregated into buckets with informative tooltips

  **UI (`ui`):**

  - Fixed `DateRangeFilter` presets to use true sliding windows (removed `startOfDay` from 7-day and 30-day ranges)
  - Added `disabled` prop to `DateRangeFilter` and `DateTimePicker` components
  - Added `onCustomChange` prop to `DateRangeFilter` for debounced custom date handling
  - Improved layout: custom date pickers now inline with preset buttons on desktop
  - Added responsive mobile layout: date pickers stack vertically with down arrow
  - Added validation error display for invalid date ranges

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 11d2679: Add ability to pause health check configurations globally. When paused, health checks continue to be scheduled but execution is skipped for all systems using that configuration. Users with manage access can pause/resume from the Health Checks config page.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ac3a4cf: ### Dynamic Bucket Sizing for Health Check Visualization

  Implements industry-standard dynamic bucket sizing for health check data aggregation, following patterns from Grafana/VictoriaMetrics.

  **What changed:**

  - Replaced fixed `bucketSize: "hourly" | "daily" | "auto"` with dynamic `targetPoints` parameter (default: 500)
  - Bucket interval is now calculated as `(endDate - startDate) / targetPoints` with a minimum of 1 second
  - Added `bucketIntervalSeconds` to aggregated response and individual buckets
  - Updated chart components to use dynamic time formatting based on bucket interval

  **Why:**

  - A 24-hour view with 1-second health checks previously returned 86,400+ data points, causing lag
  - Now returns ~500 data points regardless of timeframe, ensuring consistent chart performance
  - Charts still preserve visual fidelity through proper aggregation

  **Breaking Change:**

  - `bucketSize` parameter removed from `getAggregatedHistory` and `getDetailedAggregatedHistory` endpoints
  - Use `targetPoints` instead (defaults to 500 if not specified)

  ***

  ### Collector Aggregated Charts Fix

  Fixed issue where collector auto-charts (like HTTP request response time charts) were not showing in aggregated data mode.

  **What changed:**

  - Added `aggregatedResultSchema` to `CollectorDtoSchema`
  - Backend now returns collector aggregated schemas via `getCollectors` endpoint
  - Frontend `useStrategySchemas` hook now merges collector aggregated schemas
  - Service now calls each collector's `aggregateResult()` when building buckets
  - Aggregated collector data stored in `aggregatedResult.collectors[uuid]`

  **Why:**

  - Previously only strategy-level aggregated results were computed
  - Collectors like HTTP Request Collector have their own `aggregateResult` method
  - Without calling these, fields like `avgResponseTimeMs` and `successRate` were missing from aggregated buckets

- db1f56f: Add ephemeral field stripping to reduce database storage for health checks

  - Added `x-ephemeral` metadata flag to `HealthResultMeta` for marking fields that should not be persisted
  - All health result factory functions (`healthResultString`, `healthResultNumber`, `healthResultBoolean`, `healthResultArray`, `healthResultJSONPath`) now accept `x-ephemeral`
  - Added `stripEphemeralFields()` utility to remove ephemeral fields before database storage
  - Integrated ephemeral field stripping into `queue-executor.ts` for all collector results
  - HTTP Request collector now explicitly marks `body` as ephemeral

  This significantly reduces database storage for health checks with large response bodies, while still allowing assertions to run against the full response at execution time.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [db1f56f]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.4

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7a23261]
  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

- f533141: Enforce health result factory function usage via branded types

  - Added `healthResultSchema()` builder that enforces the use of factory functions at compile-time
  - Added `healthResultArray()` factory for array fields (e.g., DNS resolved values)
  - Added branded `HealthResultField<T>` type to mark schemas created by factory functions
  - Consolidated `ChartType` and `HealthResultMeta` into `@checkstack/common` as single source of truth
  - Updated all 12 health check strategies and 11 collectors to use `healthResultSchema()`
  - Using raw `z.number()` etc. inside `healthResultSchema()` now causes a TypeScript error

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9faec1f]
- Updated dependencies [f533141]
  - @checkstack/common@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

- 97c5a6b: Add UUID-based collector identification for better multiple collector support

  **Breaking Change**: Existing health check configurations with collectors need to be recreated.

  - Each collector instance now has a unique UUID assigned on creation
  - Collector results are stored under the UUID key with `_collectorId` and `_assertionFailed` metadata
  - Auto-charts correctly display separate charts for each collector instance
  - Charts are now grouped by collector instance with clear headings
  - Assertion status card shows pass/fail for each collector
  - Renamed "Success" to "HTTP Success" to clarify it's about HTTP request success
  - Fixed deletion of collectors not persisting to database
  - Fixed duplicate React key warnings in auto-chart grid

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8e43507]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.4

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f5b1f49: Extended health check system with per-collector assertion support.

  - Added `collectors` column to `healthCheckConfigurations` schema for storing collector configs
  - Updated queue-executor to run configured collectors and evaluate per-collector assertions
  - Added `CollectorAssertionSchema` to healthcheck-common for assertion validation
  - Results now stored with `metadata.collectors` containing per-collector result data

- f5b1f49: Added JSONPath assertions for response body validation and fully qualified strategy IDs.

  **JSONPath Assertions:**

  - Added `healthResultJSONPath()` factory in healthcheck-common for fields supporting JSONPath queries
  - Extended AssertionBuilder with jsonpath field type showing path input (e.g., `$.data.status`)
  - Added `jsonPath` field to `CollectorAssertionSchema` for persistence
  - HTTP Request collector body field now supports JSONPath assertions

  **Fully Qualified Strategy IDs:**

  - HealthCheckRegistry now uses scoped factories like CollectorRegistry
  - Strategies are stored with `pluginId.strategyId` format
  - Added `getStrategiesWithMeta()` method to HealthCheckRegistry interface
  - Router returns qualified IDs so frontend can correctly fetch collectors

  **UI Improvements:**

  - Save button disabled when collector configs have invalid required fields
  - Fixed nested button warning in CollectorList accordion

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f5b1f49]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.3
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.3

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- cb82e4d: Improved `counter` and `pie` auto-chart types to show frequency distributions instead of just the latest value. Both chart types now count occurrences of each unique value across all runs/buckets, making them more intuitive for visualizing data like HTTP status codes.

  Changed HTTP health check chart annotations: `statusCode` now uses `pie` chart (distribution view), `contentType` now uses `counter` chart (frequency count).

  Fixed scrollbar hopping when health check signals update the accordion content. All charts now update silently without layout shift or loading state flicker.

  Refactored health check visualization architecture:

  - `HealthCheckStatusTimeline` and `HealthCheckLatencyChart` now accept `HealthCheckDiagramSlotContext` directly, handling data transformation internally
  - `HealthCheckDiagram` refactored to accept context from parent, ensuring all visualizations share the same data source and update together on signals
  - `HealthCheckSystemOverview` simplified to use `useHealthCheckData` hook for consolidated data fetching with automatic signal-driven refresh

  Added `silentRefetch()` method to `usePagination` hook for background data refreshes without showing loading indicators.

  Fixed `useSignal` hook to use a ref pattern internally, preventing stale closure issues. Callbacks now always access the latest values without requiring manual memoization or refs in consumer components.

  Added signal handling to `useHealthCheckData` hook for automatic chart refresh when health check runs complete.

### Minor Changes

- 4dd644d: Enable external application (API key) access to management endpoints

  Changed `userType: "user"` to `userType: "authenticated"` for 52 endpoints across 5 packages, allowing external applications (service accounts with API keys) to call these endpoints programmatically while maintaining RBAC permission checks:

  - **incident-common**: createIncident, updateIncident, addUpdate, resolveIncident, deleteIncident
  - **maintenance-common**: createMaintenance, updateMaintenance, addUpdate, closeMaintenance, deleteMaintenance
  - **catalog-common**: System CRUD, Group CRUD, addSystemToGroup, removeSystemFromGroup
  - **healthcheck-common**: Configuration management, system associations, retention config, detailed history
  - **integration-common**: Subscription management, connection management, event discovery, delivery logs

  This enables automation use cases such as:

  - Creating incidents from external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - Scheduling maintenances from CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing catalog systems from infrastructure-as-code tools
  - Configuring health checks from deployment scripts

- ae19ff6: Add configurable state thresholds for health check evaluation

  **@checkstack/backend-api:**

  - Added `VersionedData<T>` generic interface as base for all versioned data structures
  - `VersionedConfig<T>` now extends `VersionedData<T>` and adds `pluginId`
  - Added `migrateVersionedData()` utility function for running migrations on any `VersionedData` subtype

  **@checkstack/backend:**

  - Refactored `ConfigMigrationRunner` to use the new `migrateVersionedData` utility

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-common:**

  - Added state threshold schemas with two evaluation modes (consecutive, window)
  - Added `stateThresholds` field to `AssociateHealthCheckSchema`
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC endpoint contract

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-backend:**

  - Added `stateThresholds` column to `system_health_checks` table
  - Added `state-evaluator.ts` with health status evaluation logic
  - Added `state-thresholds-migrations.ts` with migration infrastructure
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC handler

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Updated `SystemHealthBadge` to use new backend endpoint

- 0babb9c: Add public health status access and detailed history for admins

  **Permission changes:**

  - Added `healthcheck.status.read` permission with `isPublicDefault: true` for anonymous access
  - `getSystemHealthStatus`, `getSystemHealthOverview`, and `getHistory` now public
  - `getHistory` no longer returns `result` field (security)

  **New features:**

  - Added `getDetailedHistory` endpoint with `healthcheck.manage` permission
  - New `/healthcheck/history` page showing paginated run history with expandable result JSON
