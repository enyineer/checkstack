# @checkstack/healthcheck-common

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9016526: Add a `/rest/:pluginId/*` HTTP mount that serves every plugin's oRPC contract
  through the REST/OpenAPI shape described by `/api/openapi.json`. Queries are
  `GET` with query parameters, mutations are `POST` with the input as the raw
  JSON body. The existing `/api/:pluginId/*` mount continues to serve oRPC's
  native wire protocol unchanged, so existing clients are not affected.

  The OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json` now reflects the real mount: every
  `paths` entry is prefixed with `/rest` instead of `/api`.

  Also fixes a SPA-fallback bug: the backend's `/api-docs` route previously
  returned 404 on production deployments because the static-file middleware
  skipped any path starting with `/api`, capturing `/api-docs` along with real
  API routes. The skip now requires a trailing slash (`/api/`, `/rest/`).

  Required access rules are now visible in the API Docs UI. The OpenAPI spec
  generator was reading a non-existent `accessRules` field on procedure
  metadata; the real field is `access: AccessRule[]`. Each procedure's access
  rules are now flattened to fully-qualified IDs (e.g. `catalog.system.read`)
  and emitted under `x-orpc-meta.accessRules`, which the existing
  `Required Access Rules` section in the docs UI already knew how to render.

  The API Docs schema renderer now handles record types (zod `z.record`),
  `$ref`s into `components.schemas`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, nullable union
  types (`type: ["string", "null"]`), and `format` qualifiers. Previously
  record outputs like `{ statuses: object }` masked the actual value type;
  they now render as `{ [key]: <ResolvedType> { ... } }` with the inner
  schema expanded, capped at 12 levels with cycle detection.

  **REST method conventions.** `proc()` now defaults to `GET` for queries and
  `POST` for mutations on the `/rest` mount, using bracket-notation query
  params (`?filter[status]=active&ids[0]=a`) for GET inputs. Existing
  procedures were updated to follow REST semantics:

  - `update*` mutations → `PATCH`
  - `delete*` / `remove*` mutations → `DELETE`
  - `getBulk*` queries and any query taking a large array input → `POST`
    (because `@orpc/openapi@1.13.x` has no GET→POST URL-length fallback)

  GET endpoints require an `object` input — bare scalars like
  `.input(z.string())` are not valid on GET. `getSystemConfigurations` was
  refactored from `.input(z.string())` to `.input(z.object({ systemId: ... }))`
  to fit the GET shape; the only call-site update was the in-process router
  unpacking `input.systemId` instead of passing `input` directly.

  The API Docs UI now renders query parameters (path/query/header/cookie) in a
  dedicated table for GET endpoints, and the fetch example shows them in the
  URL with `<required>` / `<optional>` placeholders.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1ef12: ## Downstream consumer bumps for the anomaly detection + cache system rollout

  Packages on this branch were updated as part of the anomaly detection feature (schema annotations on result fields, plugin metadata for the modular cache system) but were not listed in the upstream changesets.

  - **`@checkstack/healthcheck-common`** (minor) — new RPC contract additions and schema changes supporting per-field anomaly metadata.
  - **`@checkstack/cache-memory-common`** (minor) — new package providing access rules + plugin metadata for the in-memory cache backend.
  - **healthcheck plugins** (patch) — adopt the new `x-anomaly-*` schema annotations on their result fields so anomaly detection works automatically against their checks. No public API changes.
  - **integration / notification / auth / queue / collector plugins** (patch) — minor internal updates as consumers of upstream API changes (cache plugin registry, schema additions). No public API changes.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f191cf: Add SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED signal and dependency-driven notification improvements

  **healthcheck-common:**

  - New `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` signal that fires only on system-level health status transitions (healthy ↔ degraded ↔ unhealthy), providing a low-noise alternative to `HEALTH_CHECK_RUN_COMPLETED` for coarse-grained reactivity

  **healthcheck-backend:**

  - Broadcast `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` signal at both status transition code paths in the queue executor

  **healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Switch `SystemHealthBadge` from `HEALTH_CHECK_RUN_COMPLETED` to `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` to reduce unnecessary refetch noise

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

- Updated dependencies [0b9fc58]
  - @checkstack/common@0.6.1
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.5

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d6f7449: Add availability statistics display to HealthCheckSystemOverview

  - New `getAvailabilityStats` RPC endpoint that calculates availability percentages for 31-day and 365-day periods
  - Availability is calculated as `(healthyRuns / totalRuns) * 100`
  - Data is sourced from both daily aggregates and recent raw runs to include the most up-to-date information
  - Frontend displays availability stats with color-coded badges (green ≥99.9%, yellow ≥99%, red <99%)
  - Shows total run counts for each period

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f81b60: ### Clickable Run History with Deep Linking

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Added `getRunById` service method to fetch a single health check run by ID

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `getRunById` RPC procedure for fetching individual runs
  - Added `historyRun` route for deep linking to specific runs (`/history/:systemId/:configurationId/:runId`)

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Table rows in Recent Runs and Run History now navigate to detailed view instead of expanding inline
  - Added "Selected Run" card that displays when navigating to a specific run
  - Extracted `ExpandedResultView` into reusable component
  - Fixed layout shift during table pagination by preserving previous data while loading
  - Removed accordion expansion in favor of consistent navigation UX

### Patch Changes

- 090143b: ### Health Check Aggregation & UI Fixes

  **Backend (`healthcheck-backend`):**

  - Fixed tail-end bucket truncation where the last aggregated bucket was cut off at the interval boundary instead of extending to the query end date
  - Added `rangeEnd` parameter to `reaggregateBuckets()` to properly extend the last bucket
  - Fixed cross-tier merge logic (`mergeTieredBuckets`) to prevent hourly aggregates from blocking fresh raw data

  **Schema (`healthcheck-common`):**

  - Added `bucketEnd` field to `AggregatedBucketBaseSchema` so frontends know the actual end time of each bucket

  **Frontend (`healthcheck-frontend`):**

  - Updated all components to use `bucket.bucketEnd` instead of calculating from `bucketIntervalSeconds`
  - Fixed aggregation mode detection: changed `>` to `>=` so 7-day queries use aggregated data when `rawRetentionDays` is 7
  - Added ref-based memoization in `useHealthCheckData` to prevent layout shift during signal-triggered refetches
  - Exposed `isFetching` state to show loading spinner during background refetches
  - Added debounced custom date range with Apply button to prevent fetching on every field change
  - Added validation preventing start date >= end date in custom ranges
  - Added sparkline downsampling: when there are 60+ data points, they are aggregated into buckets with informative tooltips

  **UI (`ui`):**

  - Fixed `DateRangeFilter` presets to use true sliding windows (removed `startOfDay` from 7-day and 30-day ranges)
  - Added `disabled` prop to `DateRangeFilter` and `DateTimePicker` components
  - Added `onCustomChange` prop to `DateRangeFilter` for debounced custom date handling
  - Improved layout: custom date pickers now inline with preset buttons on desktop
  - Added responsive mobile layout: date pickers stack vertically with down arrow
  - Added validation error display for invalid date ranges

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 11d2679: Add ability to pause health check configurations globally. When paused, health checks continue to be scheduled but execution is skipped for all systems using that configuration. Users with manage access can pause/resume from the Health Checks config page.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ac3a4cf: ### Dynamic Bucket Sizing for Health Check Visualization

  Implements industry-standard dynamic bucket sizing for health check data aggregation, following patterns from Grafana/VictoriaMetrics.

  **What changed:**

  - Replaced fixed `bucketSize: "hourly" | "daily" | "auto"` with dynamic `targetPoints` parameter (default: 500)
  - Bucket interval is now calculated as `(endDate - startDate) / targetPoints` with a minimum of 1 second
  - Added `bucketIntervalSeconds` to aggregated response and individual buckets
  - Updated chart components to use dynamic time formatting based on bucket interval

  **Why:**

  - A 24-hour view with 1-second health checks previously returned 86,400+ data points, causing lag
  - Now returns ~500 data points regardless of timeframe, ensuring consistent chart performance
  - Charts still preserve visual fidelity through proper aggregation

  **Breaking Change:**

  - `bucketSize` parameter removed from `getAggregatedHistory` and `getDetailedAggregatedHistory` endpoints
  - Use `targetPoints` instead (defaults to 500 if not specified)

  ***

  ### Collector Aggregated Charts Fix

  Fixed issue where collector auto-charts (like HTTP request response time charts) were not showing in aggregated data mode.

  **What changed:**

  - Added `aggregatedResultSchema` to `CollectorDtoSchema`
  - Backend now returns collector aggregated schemas via `getCollectors` endpoint
  - Frontend `useStrategySchemas` hook now merges collector aggregated schemas
  - Service now calls each collector's `aggregateResult()` when building buckets
  - Aggregated collector data stored in `aggregatedResult.collectors[uuid]`

  **Why:**

  - Previously only strategy-level aggregated results were computed
  - Collectors like HTTP Request Collector have their own `aggregateResult` method
  - Without calling these, fields like `avgResponseTimeMs` and `successRate` were missing from aggregated buckets

- db1f56f: Add ephemeral field stripping to reduce database storage for health checks

  - Added `x-ephemeral` metadata flag to `HealthResultMeta` for marking fields that should not be persisted
  - All health result factory functions (`healthResultString`, `healthResultNumber`, `healthResultBoolean`, `healthResultArray`, `healthResultJSONPath`) now accept `x-ephemeral`
  - Added `stripEphemeralFields()` utility to remove ephemeral fields before database storage
  - Integrated ephemeral field stripping into `queue-executor.ts` for all collector results
  - HTTP Request collector now explicitly marks `body` as ephemeral

  This significantly reduces database storage for health checks with large response bodies, while still allowing assertions to run against the full response at execution time.

### Patch Changes

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

- f533141: Enforce health result factory function usage via branded types

  - Added `healthResultSchema()` builder that enforces the use of factory functions at compile-time
  - Added `healthResultArray()` factory for array fields (e.g., DNS resolved values)
  - Added branded `HealthResultField<T>` type to mark schemas created by factory functions
  - Consolidated `ChartType` and `HealthResultMeta` into `@checkstack/common` as single source of truth
  - Updated all 12 health check strategies and 11 collectors to use `healthResultSchema()`
  - Using raw `z.number()` etc. inside `healthResultSchema()` now causes a TypeScript error

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9faec1f]
- Updated dependencies [f533141]
  - @checkstack/common@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

- 97c5a6b: Add UUID-based collector identification for better multiple collector support

  **Breaking Change**: Existing health check configurations with collectors need to be recreated.

  - Each collector instance now has a unique UUID assigned on creation
  - Collector results are stored under the UUID key with `_collectorId` and `_assertionFailed` metadata
  - Auto-charts correctly display separate charts for each collector instance
  - Charts are now grouped by collector instance with clear headings
  - Assertion status card shows pass/fail for each collector
  - Renamed "Success" to "HTTP Success" to clarify it's about HTTP request success
  - Fixed deletion of collectors not persisting to database
  - Fixed duplicate React key warnings in auto-chart grid

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8e43507]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.4

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f5b1f49: Extended health check system with per-collector assertion support.

  - Added `collectors` column to `healthCheckConfigurations` schema for storing collector configs
  - Updated queue-executor to run configured collectors and evaluate per-collector assertions
  - Added `CollectorAssertionSchema` to healthcheck-common for assertion validation
  - Results now stored with `metadata.collectors` containing per-collector result data

- f5b1f49: Added JSONPath assertions for response body validation and fully qualified strategy IDs.

  **JSONPath Assertions:**

  - Added `healthResultJSONPath()` factory in healthcheck-common for fields supporting JSONPath queries
  - Extended AssertionBuilder with jsonpath field type showing path input (e.g., `$.data.status`)
  - Added `jsonPath` field to `CollectorAssertionSchema` for persistence
  - HTTP Request collector body field now supports JSONPath assertions

  **Fully Qualified Strategy IDs:**

  - HealthCheckRegistry now uses scoped factories like CollectorRegistry
  - Strategies are stored with `pluginId.strategyId` format
  - Added `getStrategiesWithMeta()` method to HealthCheckRegistry interface
  - Router returns qualified IDs so frontend can correctly fetch collectors

  **UI Improvements:**

  - Save button disabled when collector configs have invalid required fields
  - Fixed nested button warning in CollectorList accordion

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f5b1f49]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.3
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.3

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- cb82e4d: Improved `counter` and `pie` auto-chart types to show frequency distributions instead of just the latest value. Both chart types now count occurrences of each unique value across all runs/buckets, making them more intuitive for visualizing data like HTTP status codes.

  Changed HTTP health check chart annotations: `statusCode` now uses `pie` chart (distribution view), `contentType` now uses `counter` chart (frequency count).

  Fixed scrollbar hopping when health check signals update the accordion content. All charts now update silently without layout shift or loading state flicker.

  Refactored health check visualization architecture:

  - `HealthCheckStatusTimeline` and `HealthCheckLatencyChart` now accept `HealthCheckDiagramSlotContext` directly, handling data transformation internally
  - `HealthCheckDiagram` refactored to accept context from parent, ensuring all visualizations share the same data source and update together on signals
  - `HealthCheckSystemOverview` simplified to use `useHealthCheckData` hook for consolidated data fetching with automatic signal-driven refresh

  Added `silentRefetch()` method to `usePagination` hook for background data refreshes without showing loading indicators.

  Fixed `useSignal` hook to use a ref pattern internally, preventing stale closure issues. Callbacks now always access the latest values without requiring manual memoization or refs in consumer components.

  Added signal handling to `useHealthCheckData` hook for automatic chart refresh when health check runs complete.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4dd644d: Enable external application (API key) access to management endpoints

  Changed `userType: "user"` to `userType: "authenticated"` for 52 endpoints across 5 packages, allowing external applications (service accounts with API keys) to call these endpoints programmatically while maintaining RBAC permission checks:

  - **incident-common**: createIncident, updateIncident, addUpdate, resolveIncident, deleteIncident
  - **maintenance-common**: createMaintenance, updateMaintenance, addUpdate, closeMaintenance, deleteMaintenance
  - **catalog-common**: System CRUD, Group CRUD, addSystemToGroup, removeSystemFromGroup
  - **healthcheck-common**: Configuration management, system associations, retention config, detailed history
  - **integration-common**: Subscription management, connection management, event discovery, delivery logs

  This enables automation use cases such as:

  - Creating incidents from external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - Scheduling maintenances from CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing catalog systems from infrastructure-as-code tools
  - Configuring health checks from deployment scripts

- ae19ff6: Add configurable state thresholds for health check evaluation

  **@checkstack/backend-api:**

  - `VersionedConfig<T>` now extends `VersionedData<T>` and adds `pluginId`
  - Added `migrateVersionedData()` utility function for running migrations on any `VersionedData` subtype

  **@checkstack/backend:**

  - Refactored `ConfigMigrationRunner` to use the new `migrateVersionedData` utility

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-common:**

  - Added state threshold schemas with two evaluation modes (consecutive, window)
  - Added `stateThresholds` field to `AssociateHealthCheckSchema`
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC endpoint contract

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-backend:**

  - Added `stateThresholds` column to `system_health_checks` table
  - Added `state-evaluator.ts` with health status evaluation logic
  - Added `state-thresholds-migrations.ts` with migration infrastructure
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC handler

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Updated `SystemHealthBadge` to use new backend endpoint

- 0babb9c: Add public health status access and detailed history for admins

  **Permission changes:**

  - Added `healthcheck.status.read` permission with `isPublicDefault: true` for anonymous access
  - `getSystemHealthStatus`, `getSystemHealthOverview`, and `getHistory` now public
  - `getHistory` no longer returns `result` field (security)

  **New features:**

  - Added `getDetailedHistory` endpoint with `healthcheck.manage` permission
  - New `/healthcheck/history` page showing paginated run history with expandable result JSON
