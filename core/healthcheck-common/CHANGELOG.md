# @checkstack/healthcheck-common

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- cb82e4d: Improved `counter` and `pie` auto-chart types to show frequency distributions instead of just the latest value. Both chart types now count occurrences of each unique value across all runs/buckets, making them more intuitive for visualizing data like HTTP status codes.

  Changed HTTP health check chart annotations: `statusCode` now uses `pie` chart (distribution view), `contentType` now uses `counter` chart (frequency count).

  Fixed scrollbar hopping when health check signals update the accordion content. All charts now update silently without layout shift or loading state flicker.

  Refactored health check visualization architecture:

  - `HealthCheckStatusTimeline` and `HealthCheckLatencyChart` now accept `HealthCheckDiagramSlotContext` directly, handling data transformation internally
  - `HealthCheckDiagram` refactored to accept context from parent, ensuring all visualizations share the same data source and update together on signals
  - `HealthCheckSystemOverview` simplified to use `useHealthCheckData` hook for consolidated data fetching with automatic signal-driven refresh

  Added `silentRefetch()` method to `usePagination` hook for background data refreshes without showing loading indicators.

  Fixed `useSignal` hook to use a ref pattern internally, preventing stale closure issues. Callbacks now always access the latest values without requiring manual memoization or refs in consumer components.

  Added signal handling to `useHealthCheckData` hook for automatic chart refresh when health check runs complete.

### Minor Changes

- 4dd644d: Enable external application (API key) access to management endpoints

  Changed `userType: "user"` to `userType: "authenticated"` for 52 endpoints across 5 packages, allowing external applications (service accounts with API keys) to call these endpoints programmatically while maintaining RBAC permission checks:

  - **incident-common**: createIncident, updateIncident, addUpdate, resolveIncident, deleteIncident
  - **maintenance-common**: createMaintenance, updateMaintenance, addUpdate, closeMaintenance, deleteMaintenance
  - **catalog-common**: System CRUD, Group CRUD, addSystemToGroup, removeSystemFromGroup
  - **healthcheck-common**: Configuration management, system associations, retention config, detailed history
  - **integration-common**: Subscription management, connection management, event discovery, delivery logs

  This enables automation use cases such as:

  - Creating incidents from external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - Scheduling maintenances from CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing catalog systems from infrastructure-as-code tools
  - Configuring health checks from deployment scripts

- ae19ff6: Add configurable state thresholds for health check evaluation

  **@checkstack/backend-api:**

  - Added `VersionedData<T>` generic interface as base for all versioned data structures
  - `VersionedConfig<T>` now extends `VersionedData<T>` and adds `pluginId`
  - Added `migrateVersionedData()` utility function for running migrations on any `VersionedData` subtype

  **@checkstack/backend:**

  - Refactored `ConfigMigrationRunner` to use the new `migrateVersionedData` utility

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-common:**

  - Added state threshold schemas with two evaluation modes (consecutive, window)
  - Added `stateThresholds` field to `AssociateHealthCheckSchema`
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC endpoint contract

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-backend:**

  - Added `stateThresholds` column to `system_health_checks` table
  - Added `state-evaluator.ts` with health status evaluation logic
  - Added `state-thresholds-migrations.ts` with migration infrastructure
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC handler

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Updated `SystemHealthBadge` to use new backend endpoint

- 0babb9c: Add public health status access and detailed history for admins

  **Permission changes:**

  - Added `healthcheck.status.read` permission with `isPublicDefault: true` for anonymous access
  - `getSystemHealthStatus`, `getSystemHealthOverview`, and `getHistory` now public
  - `getHistory` no longer returns `result` field (security)

  **New features:**

  - Added `getDetailedHistory` endpoint with `healthcheck.manage` permission
  - New `/healthcheck/history` page showing paginated run history with expandable result JSON
