# @checkstack/maintenance-common

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ef2e79: feat: hotlinks on incidents/maintenances and additional links on systems

  Users with `manage` access on an incident, maintenance, or system can now
  attach free-form URL "hotlinks" — Jira tickets, runbooks, dashboards, ticket
  tools, etc. — alongside the existing fields.

  - **Incidents** & **maintenances**: links live on the entity itself and are
    surfaced both in the editor dialog and on the public detail page. Two new
    RPC procedures per plugin (`addLink`, `removeLink`) gated behind the
    existing `manage` access rule. Links are returned as part of
    `getIncident` / `getMaintenance` and cache-invalidated on every link
    mutation.
  - **Systems**: a parallel `system_links` table with `getSystemLinks`,
    `addSystemLink`, `removeSystemLink` procedures. Surfaced inside the
    system editor (next to contacts) and on the read-only system detail
    sidebar. Cache-scoped per-system so list endpoints remain hot.
  - **Shared UI**: a `LinksEditor` component in `@checkstack/ui` does the
    presentation; the three plugins each own their own RPC wiring.

  Database changes ship as additive migrations (new `incident_links`,
  `maintenance_links`, `system_links` tables, all FK-cascaded on parent
  delete). No existing columns or rows are touched.

  The system incident and maintenance history pages now sort by relevance:
  active entries (non-`resolved` incidents, `scheduled` or `in_progress`
  maintenances) appear at the top, with creation date descending as the
  tiebreaker.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 18fa8e3: Add notification suppression toggle for maintenance windows

  **New Feature:** When creating or editing a maintenance window, you can now enable "Suppress health notifications" to prevent health status change notifications from being sent for affected systems while the maintenance is active (in_progress status). This is useful for planned downtime where health alerts are expected and would otherwise create noise.

  **Changes:**

  - Added `suppressNotifications` field to maintenance schema
  - Added new service-to-service API `hasActiveMaintenanceWithSuppression`
  - Healthcheck queue executor now checks for suppression before sending notifications
  - MaintenanceEditor UI includes new toggle checkbox

  **Bug Fix:** Fixed migration system to correctly set PostgreSQL search_path when running plugin migrations. Previously, migrations could fail with "relation does not exist" errors because the schema context wasn't properly set.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7a23261]
  - @checkstack/frontend-api@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-common` package with Zod schemas, permissions, oRPC contract, and extension slots
  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-backend` package with Drizzle schema, service, and oRPC router
  - New `@checkstack/maintenance-frontend` package with admin page and system detail panel
  - Shared `DateTimePicker` component added to `@checkstack/ui`
  - Database migrations for maintenances, maintenance_systems, and maintenance_updates tables

- 4dd644d: Enable external application (API key) access to management endpoints

  Changed `userType: "user"` to `userType: "authenticated"` for 52 endpoints across 5 packages, allowing external applications (service accounts with API keys) to call these endpoints programmatically while maintaining RBAC permission checks:

  - **incident-common**: createIncident, updateIncident, addUpdate, resolveIncident, deleteIncident
  - **maintenance-common**: createMaintenance, updateMaintenance, addUpdate, closeMaintenance, deleteMaintenance
  - **catalog-common**: System CRUD, Group CRUD, addSystemToGroup, removeSystemFromGroup
  - **healthcheck-common**: Configuration management, system associations, retention config, detailed history
  - **integration-common**: Subscription management, connection management, event discovery, delivery logs

  This enables automation use cases such as:

  - Creating incidents from external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - Scheduling maintenances from CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing catalog systems from infrastructure-as-code tools
  - Configuring health checks from deployment scripts
