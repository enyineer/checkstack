### Patch Changes

- 56e7c75: Hide navigation, actions and links that the current user cannot use, so anonymous
  and read-only users no longer see entries that lead to "Access Denied" or to
  actions the server would reject.

  - **Sidebar**: a nav entry can now declare a dynamic `nav.isVisible({ accessRules, isAuthenticated })` predicate (in addition to the static `accessRule`). A group whose every entry is filtered out is no longer rendered. The filtering/grouping logic is extracted to a pure, unit-tested helper.
  - **Infrastructure**: its sidebar entry is shown only when the user can READ at least one contributed tab (queue, cache, …), instead of always (it previously had no static rule because tabs are contributed at runtime).
  - **Notification Settings**: hidden from anonymous users - notifications are per-user, so an anonymous visitor can't have any.
  - **Anomaly Mute / Suppress**: the "Mute" / "Mute all" controls (a per-user preference) are hidden from anonymous visitors; the "Suppress" control is gated on `anomalyAccess.feed.manage`. Both were previously always visible.
  - **Dashboard**: the "Open Catalog" actions (which open the manage-only Catalog config page) are hidden from users without `catalogAccess.system.manage`, and the "View catalog" link is gated on `catalogAccess.system.read`.
  - **Dashboard status signals**: the per-system status rows contributed by plugins (`SystemSignalsSlot`) now render as a LINK only when the user can open the target, and as plain text otherwise. `SystemSignal` gains an optional `accessRule`; the healthcheck, anomaly, and dependency fillers set it for their gated targets (check-history / assignments / dependency-map). Signals pointing at ungated pages (incident / maintenance / SLO detail) stay links.
  - **Plugin Manager**: the "Install plugin" button (which opens the install-gated page) is hidden from users with only `plugin` view access.
  - **Satellites**: the page is entirely manage-gated, but its route/sidebar entry was gated on `read`, so read-only users saw the nav item and hit "Access Denied" on click. The route and nav entry now require `satellite.manage`.

  The `@checkstack/ai-backend` bump is only the regenerated bundled docs index
  (the frontend routing guide gained the `nav.isVisible` section); no code change.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/frontend-api`):** the `AccessApi` interface gains a
  required `useIsAuthenticated()` method. Custom `AccessApi` implementations must
  add it (it returns `{ loading, isAuthenticated }`). The built-in auth
  implementation and the no-auth fallback already do. `NavEntry` also gains an
  optional `isVisible` predicate (purely additive).

### Patch Changes

- fb705df: Upgrade React 18 to React 19 across the platform.

  **BREAKING (runtime frontend plugins):** React is shared as a Module Federation
  singleton, so the host now provides **React 19** to every runtime plugin.
  Frontend plugins built against React 18 must be rebuilt against React 19
  (`react` / `react-dom` `^19`). The scaffold templates and the host/plugin MF
  `requiredVersion` are updated to `^19`. `react` (and now `react-dom`) are pinned
  to a single version across the workspace via syncpack so the singleton can never
  skew (react and react-dom must match exactly).

  The React 19 removed-API surface was audited - the codebase used only no-arg
  `useRef()` (now `useRef<T | undefined>(undefined)`); no `ReactDOM.render`,
  legacy context, string refs, or function-component `defaultProps`. This also
  clears the `IMPORT_IS_UNDEFINED` build warnings for `React.use` /
  `React.useOptimistic` (react-router 7 feature-detection), which React 19 exports.

  The downstream `*-frontend` packages (and `@checkstack/infrastructure-common`)
  receive only the mechanical `react` dependency bump (`patch`); the framework
  packages carrying the shared-singleton change are bumped `minor`.

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Cut initial-load JS: lazy plugin contributions, a hardened lazy-by-default contribution contract, on-demand Monaco, and a lighter icon/chart load.

  - Lazy plugin route pages: each plugin's route `element` references a `React.lazy`-wrapped page rendered inside a shared `<Suspense>` boundary. Plugins still register synchronously, so nav, slots, commands, API factories, and `foreignSignals` are available on first paint. This moves ~37 route-page chunks (~600 KB) out of the entry; the entry chunk drops from ~2.4 MB to ~190 KB. Auth flow pages stay eager. The `@checkstack/scripts` scaffold template generates lazy route pages too.
  - Hardened contribution contract (BREAKING, frontend plugin contract): plugins declare contributions lazily and let the framework own code-splitting, Suspense, and per-plugin error isolation. Routes use `load: () => import("./Page").then((m) => ({ default: m.Page }))` instead of `element: <Page />` (`element` is still accepted for the rare page that must paint without a chunk fetch; provide exactly one). Slot extensions accept either an eager `component` or a lazy `load`; new `getLazyContribution` + `ExtensionComponent` exports from `@checkstack/frontend-api` render either kind. This also fixes runtime-installed plugins: `ExtensionSlot` subscribes to the plugin registry, and the API registry rebuilds when the plugin set changes (`getPlugins()` returns an immutable snapshot via `useSyncExternalStore`). A per-plugin error boundary contains a bad contribution.
  - On-demand Monaco: the `@checkstack/ui` barrel no longer pulls the `@codingame/*` / `monaco-languageclient` stack into the initial load. `CodeEditor` lazy-loads its Monaco-backed editor behind `React.lazy` + Suspense, `validateTypeScriptSources` imports the editor API via in-body `await import(...)`, and the "vscode services ready" signal moved to a Monaco-free module. The ~10 MB editor body loads only when a `CodeEditor` mounts. A `react-vendor` `manualChunks` split was added for stable vendor caching.
  - lucide-react 1.x + lighter icons/charts (BREAKING for icon consumers): lucide-react unified from three drifting ranges to `^1.17.0`. lucide v1 removed brand icons, so the GitHub/GitLab marks are vendored in `@checkstack/ui` (`GithubIcon`, `GitlabIcon`, `brandIcons`); a new `IconName` type (`LucideIconName | BrandIconName`) in `@checkstack/common` is canonical, accepted by `AuthStrategy.icon` and the card components, so data-driven brand names keep working. `DynamicIcon` no longer eagerly imports lucide's ~1600-icon map (~1 MB) - it lives in a `React.lazy` `iconRegistry` chunk fetched on first data-driven render, while statically named-imported icons tree-shake normally. The recharts-backed health-check charts (~300 KB) and the `HealthCheckSystemOverview` drawer leave the initial load.

  BREAKING CHANGES:

  - Frontend plugin contract: routes/slot contributions are lazy-by-default (`load` instead of `element`/eager elements) as described above.
  - Any external consumer importing a brand icon from `lucide-react` (e.g. `import { Github } from "lucide-react"`) must switch to the vendored `@checkstack/ui` brand icons or a custom SVG.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

### Patch Changes

- 9dcc848: Assorted bug fixes and small hardening across the platform.

  - announcement-backend: `updateAnnouncement` now invalidates the active-announcements and admin-list caches (it was missing the `invalidateAllActive` / `invalidateListAll` calls), so an edited announcement no longer stays stale up to the 45s TTL.
  - anomaly-backend: anomaly/drift state transitions (confirmations, recoveries, self-resolutions) now log at `debug` instead of info/warn - they are already surfaced via the `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED` signal, so logging them louder just added noise; genuine failure paths stay `warn`.
  - backend: the `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now populates `requestHeaders` on the per-request RPC context, so a handler that re-enters the router as the originating user (e.g. an AI tool's user-scoped client) can forward the caller's session cookie / bearer - previously the loopback failed with "Authentication required". Guarded by a real end-to-end integration test. The HTTP server idle timeout is also raised (default 255s, configurable via `CHECKSTACK_SERVER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, clamped 0-255, reset on each streamed chunk) so long AI chat SSE turns are not severed mid-stream.
  - backend: a request for an unknown plugin id (`/api/<unknown>/...`) now returns `404 Not Found` instead of `500` (and logs at warn, not error, since it is a client request) - an unknown _procedure_ on a known plugin already 404'd. The in-app docs namespace `/checkstack/*` now serves Starlight's own `404.html` with a real 404 status for a missing doc, instead of falling through to the SPA catch-all and 200-ing the app shell. Both guarded by tests.
  - automation-common: remove polynomial-time backtracking from `toShellEnvKey`'s underscore-trim (CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos`); a negative look-behind anchors the trailing run, keeping the trim linear.
  - common + script-packages-common: the pure transport-safe sandbox-policy schema (`sandboxPolicySchema` and its sub-schemas + inferred types) moved to `@checkstack/common` (the neutral base), removing two inverted deps that existed only to reach the shape; `@checkstack/backend-api` continues to re-export it. The schema is no longer exported from `@checkstack/script-packages-common`. Pure refactor, no behavior change.
  - catalog-backend: reject duplicate system names (a `CONFLICT` on create/rename, enforced by a pre-write check AND a new DB unique index on `systems.name`, migration 0004 which first resolves pre-existing duplicates by suffixing).
  - catalog-frontend: detail-page cleanups (use `<NotFound />` not `<AccessDenied />` on the not-found branch, a readable key/value metadata list via `normalizeMetadata`, runtime locale via `formatDate`); and stop the browse view re-rendering on every health report (adopt a new statuses report only when a value actually changed, via `healthStatusesEqual`, so rows stay stable and interactive).
  - healthcheck-backend: fix the daily-rollup retention step failing with an `ON CONFLICT` mismatch (SQLSTATE 42P10) after `environmentId` joined the `health_check_aggregates` unique constraint - the rollup now groups by (day, environmentId, sourceId) and uses a single exported conflict-target constant (`DAILY_AGGREGATE_CONFLICT_TARGET`) kept in lock-step with the schema by a unit test.
  - automation-frontend: the service-account picker's "Learn more" links are now absolute URLs to the deployed Astro docs site (they 404ed as in-app relative paths). The Monaco script editor double-init crash is fixed (serialized cold init, a guarded `monacoGuard` accessor, theme/type effects gated on `apiReady`).
  - auth-frontend: bound the desktop user-menu popover height (`max-h-[var(--radix-popover-content-available-height)]` + `overflow-y-auto`) so it no longer clips on short viewports, and fold the standalone `Account > Profile` item into a focusable name/email header (`profileHref` on `UserMenu`); the now-empty `Account` group no longer renders.
  - satellite-frontend: picked up via the sidebar-nav migration (account-only user menu).

  (Related UI fixes - the Monaco editor following the app theme, the `DynamicOptionsField` no-flash fix, the shared `Spinner`, GFM tables, and the user-menu popover bound - land their `@checkstack/ui` bump in the UI/perf changesets where `@checkstack/ui` is already minored.)

  This is a beta patch.

- 9dcc848: Satellite deployments now ship with the script-sandbox flags they need, so script-based health checks run on satellites out of the box.

  A satellite executes the same script checks as the core, so its container needs the same two runtime relaxations (`--security-opt seccomp=<tuned profile>` and `--security-opt systempaths=unconfined`). Without them the fail-closed sandbox refuses every script run - the satellite connects but script checks error. These flags were missing from every satellite deployment path.

  - satellite-frontend: the "Satellite created" dialog now shows a complete, ready-to-run `docker run` deploy command (including both `--security-opt` flags and the seccomp-profile extract step) instead of just the three environment variables, with a warning that the flags are required for script checks and a link to the sandbox docs.
  - The tuned seccomp profile is now bundled INSIDE the satellite image and exposed via a `print-seccomp` entrypoint subcommand (`docker run --rm <image> print-seccomp > checkstack-userns.json`). This is what makes the secure default work in air-gapped networks: the Docker daemon reads the profile from a host file at container-create time and a container cannot relax its own seccomp from the inside, so the operator must place the file before `docker run` - and now it travels with the image (no GitHub, no core round-trip), version-matched to the agent.
  - New `docker-compose-satellite.yml` for standalone (remote-host) satellite deployments, with the flags and the extract step documented. The footgun commented-out satellite block in `docker-compose.yml` (which had no `security_opt`) was removed in favor of it.
  - Docs: the "Connect a satellite" guide and the script-sandbox "Satellite runtime" section now cover the required flags, the offline profile extract, the bootstrap constraint, and the `unconfined` / `degrade` fallbacks.

  This is a beta patch.

- 9dcc848: Move primary navigation into a left sidebar, and serve the user guide in-app.

  Feature navigation (a ~20-item user-menu dropdown) now lives in a persistent left sidebar (a slide-over drawer on mobile), grouped by section with the active route highlighted; the user menu keeps only account actions. A route opts into the sidebar with new `nav` metadata (`{ group, icon, label?, order?, accessRule? }`) on its registration, co-located with path + access + title. The sidebar filters entries with the same access check as page guards. `@checkstack/common` gains `isAccessRuleSatisfied` and a centralized set of in-app doc slugs (`APP_DOC_SLUGS` + `docsPath`, with a test asserting each resolves to a real docs page); `@checkstack/auth-frontend` exports `useAccessRules`.

  The backend now serves the Astro Starlight docs build same-origin at `/checkstack/*` (the same artifact deployed to GitHub Pages), so the user guide is available inside the app including for self-hosted / air-gapped installs (served verbatim, no rebuild, no link rewriting; from `CHECKSTACK_DOCS_DIST`, before the SPA catch-all, degrading gracefully when absent; the Docker image builds and ships `docs/dist`; Vite proxies `/checkstack` in dev). The "Docs" link is a shell-owned external sidebar entry under the Documentation group (book icon), opening `/checkstack/user-guide/` in a new tab; the group renders even when no plugin route contributes to it.

  BREAKING (plugin authors): `UserMenuItemsSlot` is no longer the way to add navigation - registering a top user-menu item no longer surfaces it anywhere. Add `nav` to the page's route instead. `UserMenuItemsBottomSlot` (account items) is unchanged. All bundled plugins have been migrated.

  This is a beta minor.

### Patch Changes

- f23f3c9: Standardise the empty / loading / error story on key list pages using

  through the same `isLoading -> isError -> empty -> data` ladder, so
  failed queries surface a retry-able inline error instead of silently
  rendering an empty table, and loading states match the final layout
  rather than flashing a generic spinner. No layout, business logic, or
  query input shapes changed.

### Minor Changes

- f6f9a5c: Add a GitOps `Satellite` kind plus a UI affordance for resetting tokens.

  GitOps owns satellite **metadata only** — `metadata.name`,
  `spec.region`, and `metadata.labels` (used as the satellite's runtime
  tags). The bcrypt token is intentionally never expressed in YAML; on
  first reconcile a satellite is created with a random token that is
  discarded, and operators must use the Satellites page to retrieve a
  working credential.

  To support that flow:

  - New service methods: `updateSatelliteMetadata`, `rotateSatelliteToken`,
    `getSatelliteByName`.
  - New RPC procs: `updateSatellite`, `rotateSatelliteToken`.
  - New `RotateSatelliteTokenDialog` and a "Reset token" key icon on the
    Satellites list. The dialog reuses the one-time-reveal layout from
    `CreateSatelliteDialog`.
  - The Satellites list shows a `GitOpsSourceBadge` next to managed
    satellites and disables the delete button while leaving the
    token-reset button enabled (so operators can always re-issue a
    credential without touching YAML).

  The satellite kind reconciler adopts pre-existing satellites by name on
  first sync, so this is safe to roll out against installations that
  already have manually-created satellites.

- 3547670: Wire the new tips infrastructure across the frontends:

  **Empty-state coaching.** Replace generic "no items" copy with onboarding
  guidance — short description, three numbered steps and a primary CTA — on
  every EmptyState that has a meaningful next action. Affects: catalog
  (systems + groups), dashboard, health-check page, integrations (subscriptions

  - provider connections), GitOps providers + secrets, GitOps provenance,
    SLO config + overview, maintenance config, satellites, plugin manager,
    incident config, announcements. Read-only EmptyStates (incident history,
    maintenance history, plugin events) get clearer descriptions explaining
    what would populate them.

  **First-run anchored tips.** Add `<Tip>` popovers to the most important
  "Create" affordances so first-time users see a one-line explanation of
  what they're about to make and why it matters: catalog “Add System” /
  “Add Group”, healthcheck “Create Check”, integrations “New Subscription”,
  GitOps “Add Provider”, SLO “Create SLO”, maintenance “Create Maintenance”,
  satellite “Create Satellite”, plugin-manager “Install plugin”, incident
  “Report Incident”, announcement “New Announcement”. Each tip is dismissed
  per user (server-backed when signed in, localStorage otherwise) and
  namespaced through `qualifyTipId(plugin, …)` so it cannot escape the
  plugin's own namespace.

  **Welcome banner on the dashboard.** A `<TipBanner>` at the top of the
  dashboard introduces Checkstack's main flow ("add a system, then a health
  check") with a one-click jump into the catalog.

### Patch Changes

- 950d6ec: Fix mobile UserMenu items rendering at zero height, group menu items by
  section, and unstack cramped card headers on small viewports.

  - **UserMenu mobile bug**: On mobile, the user-menu Sheet rendered every
    menu item as a grid row, which combined with `flex-shrink: 1` on each
    item collapsed the buttons whose internal layout uses `display: flex`
    (the items registered with `useNavigate` rather than `<Link>`) to zero
    content height. Switched the mobile container to a flex column with
    `[&>*]:shrink-0` and added `min-h-0` so the sheet scrolls correctly
    when the list overflows.

  - **UserMenu grouping**: Slot extensions now accept an optional `group`
    field. The user menu buckets `UserMenuItemsSlot` extensions by `group`
    and renders each group under a labeled header (`Workspace`,
    `Reliability`, `Configuration`, `Documentation`, `Account`). Existing
    core plugins are tagged with the appropriate group; third-party plugins
    can pick any of these or supply their own label. Untagged extensions
    render last with no header. `UserMenuItemsBottomSlot` is unaffected.

  - **Card header responsiveness**: `CardHeaderRow` (the primitive shared by
    Incident, Maintenance, Auth, Catalog, GitOps and other config cards) now
    stacks vertically on narrow viewports and only switches to a single row
    at the `sm` breakpoint, so titles and adjacent filter controls (e.g.
    status `Select`, "Show resolved" checkbox) no longer cram together on
    mobile. Refactored the Incident and Maintenance config pages to use the
    primitive instead of a hand-rolled `flex items-center justify-between`
    row, and made their `Select` triggers full-width on mobile.

## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Patch Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.
