# @checkstack/gitops-frontend

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 86bab6a: ### GitOps: Fix authentication token handling

  - Made `authToken` optional in `ReconcileProviderParams` and `ScraperOptions` to support unauthenticated access to public repositories
  - GitHub and GitLab scrapers now conditionally set authentication headers only when a token is provided
  - Sync worker now decrypts the encrypted `authToken` from the database before passing it to scrapers, fixing authentication failures caused by sending encrypted values in HTTP headers

  ### SLO: Fix premature Nines Club achievement unlock

  - The "Nines Club" achievement now requires both ≥99.99% availability **and** a 365-day compliance streak, preventing immediate unlock on newly created SLOs with 100% default availability

  ### SLO: Align frontend achievement descriptions with backend criteria

  - Fixed mismatched descriptions for Iron Uptime (7-day, not 30), Diamond Uptime (30-day, not 90), Clean Sheet (rolling window, not quarter), Full Coverage (3+ SLOs, not all systems in group), and Nines Club (99.99%)

  ### SLO: Enrich milestones with system names

  - The `getRecentMilestones` endpoint now resolves human-readable system names via the Catalog API instead of returning raw system IDs

- Updated dependencies [86bab6a]
  - @checkstack/gitops-common@0.1.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c40b5b: Generalized provenance system and GitOps frontend plugin

  **Breaking**: `EntityKindDefinition.reconcile()` now returns `{ entityId: string }` instead of `void`. Plugins must return the plugin-specific entity ID (e.g., catalog system UUID) so the engine can store it in provenance.

  - Added `entityId` column to the provenance table (non-nullable)
  - Reconciler engine passes `existingEntityId` to plugins for updates
  - `getProvenance` now supports lookup by `entityId` in addition to `entityName`
  - Added provider CRUD endpoints: `createProvider`, `updateProvider`, `deleteProvider`
  - Created `gitops-frontend` plugin with provider management, secret management, and sync status dashboard
  - Removed `gitops_entity_name` metadata markers from catalog entities
  - Removed `findSystemByGitOpsName`, `deleteSystemByGitOpsName` (and Group equivalents) from EntityService
  - Added provenance-based UI locking in catalog-frontend: edit/delete/drag disabled for GitOps-managed systems and groups

- 6c40b5b: Add Kind Registry browser and developer documentation

  - Added `gitopsAccess.kinds.read` access rule for standalone Kind Registry access
  - Added `describeKinds()` method to the internal entity kind registry, serializing Zod schemas to JSON Schema
  - Added `listKinds` RPC endpoint gated by the new access rule
  - Created standalone Kind Registry page with schema visualization, extension listing, and auto-generated YAML examples
  - Added Kind Registry link to the user menu
  - Created developer documentation for entity kind and extension registration in `docs/backend/gitops-entity-kinds.md`
