### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 3f36a64: Add System Dependencies plugin

  Introduces the system dependencies feature with three new core plugins and
  extends the catalog with a new SystemEditorSlot extension point.

  **New plugins:**

  - **dependency-common**: Shared Zod schemas, RPC contract with resource-level access control, signal definitions, and routes
  - **dependency-backend**: Drizzle schema, DependencyService with cycle detection, WarningEvaluationService with transitive impact matrix, RPC router with signal broadcasting, and per-user canvas node position persistence
  - **dependency-frontend**: DependencyBadge (dashboard), DependencyAlert (system details), DependencyEditor (system editor dialog), and interactive DependencyMapPage (React Flow canvas)

  **Catalog extensions:**

  - **catalog-common**: New `SystemEditorSlot` for plugin-injected sections in the system editor dialog
  - **catalog-frontend**: `SystemEditor` renders the slot after TeamAccessEditor for existing systems

  **Key capabilities:**

  - Directional dependency edges between systems (source depends on target)
  - Three impact types: informational, degraded, critical
  - Transitive multi-hop warning propagation with toggle switch
  - Cycle detection at creation time with graphical chain visualization
  - Health check-level dependency rules
  - Interactive dependency map with drag-to-connect, edge click editor, and auto-saving node positions
  - Inline editing of dependencies in both the system editor and the map canvas
  - Team-based resource-level access control on all mutation endpoints
  - Realtime signal-driven UI updates
