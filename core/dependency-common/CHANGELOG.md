### Minor Changes

- 3f36a64: Add System Dependencies plugin

  Introduces the system dependencies feature with three new core plugins and
  extends the catalog with a new SystemEditorSlot extension point.

  **New plugins:**

  - **dependency-common**: Shared Zod schemas, RPC contract with resource-level access control, signal definitions, and routes
  - **dependency-backend**: Drizzle schema, DependencyService with cycle detection, WarningEvaluationService with transitive impact matrix, RPC router with signal broadcasting, and per-user canvas node position persistence
  - **dependency-frontend**: DependencyBadge (dashboard), DependencyAlert (system details), DependencyEditor (system editor dialog), and interactive DependencyMapPage (React Flow canvas)

  **Catalog extensions:**

  - **catalog-common**: New `SystemEditorSlot` for plugin-injected sections in the system editor dialog
  - **catalog-frontend**: `SystemEditor` renders the slot after TeamAccessEditor for existing systems

  **Key capabilities:**

  - Directional dependency edges between systems (source depends on target)
  - Three impact types: informational, degraded, critical
  - Transitive multi-hop warning propagation with toggle switch
  - Cycle detection at creation time with graphical chain visualization
  - Health check-level dependency rules
  - Interactive dependency map with drag-to-connect, edge click editor, and auto-saving node positions
  - Inline editing of dependencies in both the system editor and the map canvas
  - Team-based resource-level access control on all mutation endpoints
  - Realtime signal-driven UI updates
