## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- fc64fad: Dependencies can now be scoped to a specific environment and/or health check of
  the upstream system, each with its own severity - a "matrix" of scope cells.

  Previously a dependency watched the upstream's overall health (any check, any
  environment) at the edge's impact type, with optional per-check rules. That
  default is unchanged: with no scope cells configured, the dependency behaves
  exactly as before. Now each cell pins a check (a specific configuration, or
  "any"), an environment (a specific environment, or "any"), and a severity
  (informational / degraded / critical). When a dependency has any cells, only
  those slices are watched (they replace the whole-system watch) and the worst
  result across cells wins. This lets you express, e.g., "System A depends on
  System B only in `prod`", or "only when B's TLS check in `prod` fails", and lets
  different cells carry different severities.

  Because each environment is evaluated on its own slice, a scoped dependency
  catches an environment-specific outage that the upstream's overall status
  (worst-wins across environments) would otherwise hide. The dependency evaluator
  now reads per-(check, environment) health via a new
  `@checkstack/healthcheck-common` bulk contract `getBulkSystemHealthMatrix` (and
  its `@checkstack/healthcheck-backend` implementation), which returns each
  system's cross-environment rollup plus a per-environment slice. Incident
  overrides still fold into the overall rollup, so incident-forced statuses keep
  propagating through dependencies.

  The scope-cell store gains a nullable `environment_id` column and makes
  `health_check_id` nullable (forward-only migration; existing rows keep working
  as "any check, any environment"). The dependency editor's per-check panel
  becomes a scope-matrix editor with check + environment + severity rows.

  Transitive (multi-hop) dependencies still cascade using the upstream's overall
  status; per-environment cascades across multiple hops are not yet propagated.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0cac684: Make the dependency map authenticated-only by construction. `getAllDependencies`
  moves from `userType: "public"` to `"authenticated"`, so no map-gated procedure
  is public anymore and `dependency.map.read` drops out of the anonymous-usable
  rule set - the role editor and auth-backend now refuse to grant it to the
  anonymous role. This removes the previously documented option of exposing the
  full topology map to anonymous visitors (per-system dependency warnings stay on
  the public `dependency.dependency.read` rule) and eliminates the guest 401s
  from the map page's `getNodePositions` (`userType: "user"`) call, which anonymous
  visitors could otherwise trigger.

  BREAKING CHANGE: an existing `dependency.map.read` grant on the anonymous role
  becomes inert (guests are rejected by the auth middleware before access rules
  are consulted); the dependency map is now always a signed-in surface.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d912a3: Make the frontend fully RLAC-aware so team-scoped users see and can use exactly
  what the backend already authorises - no more, no less. Previously every nav
  entry, route, management page, create button, per-row action, and resource
  picker gated purely on a user's GLOBAL access rule, so a user whose team manages
  a system saw none of the surfaces the backend would happily let them use, and
  (where a page did render) could select systems they don't manage and only fail
  after submit.

  Platform primitives (on `AccessApi`, from `@checkstack/frontend-api`, implemented
  in `@checkstack/auth-frontend`). Each ORs the global RBAC rule with team-derived
  (ReBAC) grants, so a global-rule holder always sees everything:

  - `useCanCreate({ accessRule, objectType, parentType? })` - may the user create
    this type (global rule, a team `creator` grant, or managing a parent resource).
  - `useCanAccessType({ accessRule, objectType, parentType? })` - may the user
    reach a management SURFACE for this type at all (create capability OR managing
    any existing object of the type / its parent). Powers route guards, sidebar
    entries, and a management page's top-level `allowed`.
  - `useResourceAccess({ accessRule, objectType, resourceIds })` - a `canAccess(id)`
    predicate for per-row controls and for filtering resource pickers.

  Backed by three authenticated `auth` RPC procedures - `canCreate`,
  `myManageableTypes`, and `listMyAccessibleResources` - the frontend-facing
  mirrors of the existing S2S authorization endpoints, resolved against the
  caller's own team grants.

  Route/nav gating is now capability-aware: a route may declare
  `manageCapability: { objectType, parentType? }`; the route guard and sidebar then
  show/allow it for team-scoped users via `myManageableTypes`. Applied to the
  catalog, incident, maintenance, SLO, healthcheck, automation, and status-page
  management routes. The route guard resolves this through a single
  `useRouteAccess` hook with a constant hook count, since the guard is reconciled
  in place as the URL changes (a conditional hook there would trip the rules of
  hooks).

  Resource types are now typed, plugin-qualified constants. A new
  `resourceType(pluginMetadata, localType)` factory in `@checkstack/common` mints a
  nominal `ResourceType`, and each `*-common` package exports its constants (e.g.
  `catalogResourceTypes.system`, `incidentResourceTypes.incident`). The capability
  APIs accept `ResourceType`, so a mistyped `"catalog.system"` string now fails
  typecheck instead of silently breaking a gate.

  Resource pickers now offer only what the backend will accept:

  - Incident and maintenance "Affected Systems" pickers show only systems the user
    manages (or all with the global rule), matching the backend's requirement of
    MANAGE on every referenced system.
  - SLO creation is now system-scoped end to end: `createObjective` gains a
    `catalog.system` parent gate (managing the target system authorises creating an
    SLO for it, like incident/maintenance), and the SLO editor's system picker is
    filtered to manageable systems.
  - Catalog group and environment membership (add-to-group / add-to-environment,
    per-row and bulk) is gated on managing the system being (re)assigned.
  - The health-check assignment surface (Assignment IDE + the system-detail
    "Health Checks" action) requires MANAGE on the target system.

  Catalog membership chips only render a removable "x" for systems the user
  manages (removing a group/environment membership requires managing the system),
  and the Dependency Map only lets a user originate an edge from a system they
  manage (the source is access-checked; the target is not).

  Owning-team correctness: a parent-gated creator (team member, no global rule)
  who left the owning team unset previously created an object with no team grant -
  which they then could not edit. The `authorizeCreate` parent-gate path now
  resolves an owning team instead of silently orphaning the object (auto-assigns
  when the caller belongs to exactly one team, requires an explicit choice when
  several), and the `TeamOwnershipPicker` marks the field required and
  auto-selects the sole eligible team.

  Dependency writes are fixed to authorize on the SOURCE system. `createDependency`
  / `updateDependency` / `deleteDependency` previously used `instanceAccess:
{ idParam: "systemId" }`, which made the middleware look for a `dependency` grant
  keyed by the system id - a grant that never exists - so every team-scoped source
  manager was denied ("Access denied to resource dependency:<systemId>"). They now
  `parentScope` on `catalog.system` manage, so managing the source system
  authorises editing its dependencies (the target is not access-checked), matching
  health-check assignment.

  The backend authorization changes are limited to: the new read-only capability
  procedures (`canCreate` / `myManageableTypes` / `listMyAccessibleResources`), the
  SLO create parent gate, the `authorizeCreate` owning-team resolution, and the
  dependency source-scope fix. Everything else only aligns the UI with
  authorization the backend already enforced.

  instead of pulling a whole package's component graph when only one
  provider/hook is imported (e.g. importing `SessionProvider` no longer dragged an
  admin form). It is build metadata only - no runtime behavior change.

### Minor Changes

- d2077bd: Platform-wide team-scoped access control on a unified relation-tuple store.

  Admins can scope any resource to teams, and the **platform** (not each plugin)
  enforces it. A plugin opts in declaratively by adding `instanceAccess` to a
  procedure's contract; the auth middleware does the rest, so enforcement is
  consistent across catalog, health checks, incidents, maintenances, SLOs,
  automations, and the dependency map, and any third-party plugin gets it for free.

  Core model:

  - **Teams are optional.** A resource with no team grants behaves exactly as
    before.
  - **Team grants are additive and restrict who can CHANGE a resource, not who can
    SEE it.** Granting a team `Manage` lets its members view and change the
    resource; `Read-only` lets them view it. Either level grants access to team
    members **even when they lack the global permission**, and granting never
    removes read from anyone who already had it (e.g. a public status page stays
    readable). Privacy is a separate, explicit opt-in via the **Private** toggle,
    which removes the global read path so only the resource's teams can see it.
  - **Ownership at creation.** Create forms expose an **Owning team** picker. A
    non-admin can create a resource for a team they belong to that holds a
    create-capability grant for that type; the new resource is auto-granted to that
    team. Incidents and maintenances are **parent-gated**: anyone who can manage a
    system may open incidents/maintenances for it, no separate grant needed.
  - **Meaningful authorization errors.** A caller with neither the global rule nor
    any team grant for a resource type gets a `403` with a structured body instead
    of a silently-empty `200`. Anonymous callers on public endpoints are never
    `403`'d, so status pages keep rendering.

  Unified relation-tuple store:

  - The previously separate access primitives (`resource_team_access.canRead` /
    `.canManage`, ownership, `resource_access_settings.teamOnly`, and
    `resource_create_grant`) are collapsed onto ONE
    `relation_tuple(object, relation, subject)` store: "a team has
    `viewer`/`editor`/`owner` on an object, or `creator` on a type". Privacy is an
    explicit **`private` marker** tuple — its **presence** closes the global read
    path (team grants only), its **absence** is the readable-by-default state, so a
    private resource with zero grants is correctly inaccessible to everyone rather
    than silently globalized. The access decision is a pure, unit-tested function.
  - The auth API is generic: `writeRelation` / `removeRelation` / `setObjectPublic`
    / `listObjectRelations` / `listSubjectRelations` / `setCreateGrant` /
    `listTeamCreateGrants` (user-facing) and `check` / `listAccessibleObjectIds` /
    `hasAnyTypeGrant` / `authorizeCreate` / `setOwner` / `deleteObjectRelations`
    (service-to-service). Migration `0008` backfills tuples from the legacy tables
    and drops them.

  Explicit per-procedure scoping:

  - Access rules (`access()` / `accessPair()`) define only the rule (id, level,
    defaults); every procedure declares its own `instanceAccess`. This removes a
    "loaded gun" default that silently applied a shared `idParam` to any procedure
    which forgot its own override.
  - Modes: `idParam` (single-resource pre-check, fails **closed** if the id does
    not resolve), `listKey` / `recordKey` (post-filter a list/record to the
    accessible subset), `create` (authorize creation + write the owning-team
    grant), `parentScope` (scope by read/manage access to a PARENT type,
    cross-plugin single-hop: "you may see incidents/maintenances/SLOs/health for
    system S iff you may see S"), and `global: true` (the honest "intentionally not
    team-scoped" opt-out). A boot-time validator **rejects** any procedure gated on
    a team-scopable resource type that declares no `instanceAccess`, turning the
    previous fail-open into a boot error.

  Teams administration:

  - **Team managers** manage their own team's members and managers without the
    global `auth.teams.manage` rule; creating, deleting, and granting a team access
    remain admin-only.
  - A **standalone Teams page** (gated on `auth.teams.read`) lets managers reach
    team administration without the admin Auth Settings page; members are added via
    a debounced directory picker.
  - A **cross-plugin `ResourceResolverRegistry`** lets owning plugins register a
    name/search resolver for their resource types, so the Teams page lists a team's
    grants **by name** (grouped by type) and offers a resource picker — an admin can
    change a grant's level, revoke it, or add one, without auth depending on every
    plugin. Resolvers shipped for catalog systems, health-check configurations,
    incidents, maintenances, SLO objectives, and automations.

  Frontend:

  - The resource-side editor is **"Who can change this"** (one Manage checkbox per
    team; unticked = read-only), with an always-visible **Private** toggle
    (disabled until a team that can Manage exists, so a resource can't be stranded).
  - `TeamOwnershipPicker` explains _why_ there's nothing to pick (not a member of
    any team, or none of your teams manage the selected parent) instead of a bare
    "global resource" line.
  - Read-only **"who can change this"** indicators on resource detail pages expand
    to the actual people by name; bulk + per-row **Scope to team** actions in the
    catalog systems list; and the team-access copy spells out that grants are
    additive and that Read-only grants view (not change) even without the global
    permission.

  Security hardening:

  - Child deletes in catalog (`removeSystemContact` / `removeSystemLink`) are scoped
    to both the child id and its parent `systemId`, closing a cross-system IDOR for
    team-scoped managers.
  - `searchUsers` is restricted to team administrators, closing a directory/email
    enumeration path opened by the default `auth.teams.read` rule.
  - Grant setters reject unregistered resource types.

  BREAKING CHANGES (beta; shipped as minor bumps):

  - `access()` and `accessPair()` no longer accept `idParam` / `listKey` /
    `recordKey`; move instance config to the procedure's `instanceAccess`.
  - Boot fails if a procedure gated on a team-scopable resource type omits
    `instanceAccess`. Declare a scoping mode or `instanceAccess: { global: true }`.
  - The `AuthService` interface is reshaped: `check`, `listAccessibleObjectIds`,
    `hasAnyTypeGrant`, `authorizeCreate` (returns `isPrivate`), `setOwner`
    (`isPrivate`), and `deleteObjectRelations`. Custom `AuthService` implementations
    and mocks must update.
  - The auth RPC contract's per-concept resource-access endpoints are replaced by
    the generic tuple API above; external callers of the old
    `getResourceTeamAccess` / `setResourceTeamAccess` / `setResourceAccessSettings`
    / `grantResourceCreate` / etc. must move to the new procedures.
  - Several contract inputs changed from a bare `string` to an object so the
    middleware can resolve the resource id: catalog `deleteSystem` (`{ id }`),
    `removeSystemContact` / `removeSystemLink` (`{ id, systemId }`); health-check
    `deleteConfiguration` / `pauseConfiguration` / `resumeConfiguration` (`{ id }`).
    All in-tree callers are updated.
  - List/record endpoints that relied on returning an empty `200` to signal "no
    access" now return a `403` for categorically-unauthorized principals.
  - The mis-keyed bulk endpoints `getBulkIncidentsForSystems`,
    `getBulkMaintenancesForSystems`, and `getBulkObjectivesForSystems` no longer
    post-filter their (systemId-keyed) result; access is already gated by
    `catalog.system` upstream.
  - Team membership/manager mutations (`addUserToTeam`, `removeUserFromTeam`,
    `addTeamManager`, `removeTeamManager`) now require `auth.teams.read` instead of
    `auth.teams.manage` at the contract level (broadened to per-team managers).
  - The `resource_team_access`, `resource_access_settings`, and
    `resource_create_grant` tables are dropped (data backfilled into
    `relation_tuple` by migration `0008`). A previously inconsistent "team-only with
    zero grants" resource is now correctly inaccessible to global-access holders.

### Minor Changes

- 0b6f01b: feat(dependency): contribute dependency warnings to the backend system.issues aggregator

  The dependency plugin now registers a `system.issues` contributor (sourceId
  `dependency`) from its backend `init`, so the AI assistant surfaces upstream
  dependency problems alongside incidents, SLOs, health checks, and anomalies.

  The contributor enforces its own `dependency.read` access gate (returning an
  empty map - never throwing - when the principal lacks access; service users are
  trusted), then evaluates dependency warnings for every system that participates
  in a dependency edge by reading the shared, durable `dependencies` table. The
  answer is therefore identical on every pod. Only systems with an actual warning
  appear in the result.

  The row->signal mapping (source/tone/label/detail/href/accessRule/iconName) is
  extracted into a new pure `deriveDependencySignals` deriver in
  `@checkstack/dependency-common`, shared by both the backend contributor and the
  frontend `DependencySignalsFiller` so the two surfaces stay in lockstep. The
  frontend filler now delegates to that deriver with unchanged behavior.

## 1.2.5

### Patch Changes

- f9cfdae: fix(dependency): gate the dependency map behind its own non-public access rule

  Anonymous users could see the "Dependency Map" nav entry and open the page
  (which then rendered empty) because the map was gated by `dependency.read`,
  which is public so that dependency _warning_ badges stay visible on the
  catalog and dashboard.

  The full topology map is now gated by a dedicated `dependency.map` access
  rule that is granted to authenticated users by default but is NOT public, so
  anonymous visitors no longer see the nav entry or reach the page. The
  `getAllDependencies`, `getNodePositions`, and `saveNodePositions` endpoints
  move to this rule too, and the dashboard dependency signal now renders as
  plain text (not a map link) for users without map access. Per-system
  dependency warnings stay on the public `dependency.read` rule, so warning
  badges/alerts/signals remain visible to everyone as before.

  Admins can still grant `dependency.map` to the anonymous role to make the
  map public again.

  Note: the default-rule sync is add-only, so on existing deployments the
  anonymous role keeps any rules already granted. Since `dependency.map` is a
  brand-new rule the anonymous role never had it, so the map is hidden from
  anonymous users immediately after upgrade with no admin action required.

## 1.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 56e7c75: Fix frontend access checks to use FULLY-QUALIFIED access-rule ids, and resolve
  the anonymous role on the frontend.

  Granted access-rule ids are stored fully-qualified as `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` (e.g.
  `incident.incident.read`) so two plugins defining the same short rule id never
  collide. The frontend, however, was checking the UNqualified id (`incident.read`)
  via `isAccessRuleSatisfied`, so every check failed for any user without the `*`
  (admin) grant - masked in development because dev-auth grants `*`. This silently
  broke ALL non-admin frontend gating (route guards, sidebar entries, and
  `useAccess`-based button/link gating).

  - **`@checkstack/common`**: `AccessRule` now carries a REQUIRED owning `pluginId`;
    `access()` / `accessPair()` require and stamp it; `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
    qualifies the rule (`{pluginId}.{id}`, plus the manage->read escalation) and
    matches ONLY the qualified form. There is intentionally NO unqualified fallback
    - matching a bare id would let one plugin's grant satisfy another plugin's
      identically-named rule (a cross-plugin privilege-escalation flaw). Every plugin
      that defines access rules now passes its own `pluginId`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend`**: `pluginManager.getAllAccessRules()` no longer strips
    the `pluginId` field (the rule `id` is already fully-qualified for the DB sync).
  - **Route guard** (`@checkstack/frontend` / `@checkstack/frontend-api`) now
    checks the FULL rule object (so it qualifies and escalates), not a bare id.
  - **Anonymous role on the frontend**: the `accessRules` procedure is now
    `public`, returning the configurable anonymous role's grants to unauthenticated
    callers; `useAccessRules` fetches them for guests instead of returning an empty
    set. So anonymous UI now reflects exactly what the anonymous role is allowed -
    which an admin can change (`isPublic` is only the seeded default).
  - Incident / maintenance / SLO detail routes are now read-gated (their read rule
    is an `isPublic` default, so the anonymous role holds it unless an admin
    revokes it); their dashboard status signals carry that rule and render as a
    link only when the viewer may open it.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/common`):** `AccessRule.pluginId` is now REQUIRED, and
  `access()` / `accessPair()` require a `pluginId` option. `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
  matches ONLY the fully-qualified `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` form - the previous
  unqualified fallback is removed, because it was a cross-plugin
  privilege-escalation flaw. Any code constructing an `AccessRule` or calling
  `access()`/`accessPair()` must supply the owning `pluginId`.

  Verified live against an anonymous caller: read pages resolve (qualified match),
  manage actions are denied, manage->read escalation and `*` still work.

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

### Minor Changes

- 9016526: Add a `/rest/:pluginId/*` HTTP mount that serves every plugin's oRPC contract
  through the REST/OpenAPI shape described by `/api/openapi.json`. Queries are
  `GET` with query parameters, mutations are `POST` with the input as the raw
  JSON body. The existing `/api/:pluginId/*` mount continues to serve oRPC's
  native wire protocol unchanged, so existing clients are not affected.

  The OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json` now reflects the real mount: every
  `paths` entry is prefixed with `/rest` instead of `/api`.

  Also fixes a SPA-fallback bug: the backend's `/api-docs` route previously
  returned 404 on production deployments because the static-file middleware
  skipped any path starting with `/api`, capturing `/api-docs` along with real
  API routes. The skip now requires a trailing slash (`/api/`, `/rest/`).

  Required access rules are now visible in the API Docs UI. The OpenAPI spec
  generator was reading a non-existent `accessRules` field on procedure
  metadata; the real field is `access: AccessRule[]`. Each procedure's access
  rules are now flattened to fully-qualified IDs (e.g. `catalog.system.read`)
  and emitted under `x-orpc-meta.accessRules`, which the existing
  `Required Access Rules` section in the docs UI already knew how to render.

  The API Docs schema renderer now handles record types (zod `z.record`),
  `$ref`s into `components.schemas`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, nullable union
  types (`type: ["string", "null"]`), and `format` qualifiers. Previously
  record outputs like `{ statuses: object }` masked the actual value type;
  they now render as `{ [key]: <ResolvedType> { ... } }` with the inner
  schema expanded, capped at 12 levels with cycle detection.

  **REST method conventions.** `proc()` now defaults to `GET` for queries and
  `POST` for mutations on the `/rest` mount, using bracket-notation query
  params (`?filter[status]=active&ids[0]=a`) for GET inputs. Existing
  procedures were updated to follow REST semantics:

  - `update*` mutations → `PATCH`
  - `delete*` / `remove*` mutations → `DELETE`
  - `getBulk*` queries and any query taking a large array input → `POST`
    (because `@orpc/openapi@1.13.x` has no GET→POST URL-length fallback)

  GET endpoints require an `object` input — bare scalars like
  `.input(z.string())` are not valid on GET. `getSystemConfigurations` was
  refactored from `.input(z.string())` to `.input(z.object({ systemId: ... }))`
  to fit the GET shape; the only call-site update was the in-process router
  unpacking `input.systemId` instead of passing `input` directly.

  The API Docs UI now renders query parameters (path/query/header/cookie) in a
  dedicated table for GET endpoints, and the fetch example shows them in the
  URL with `<required>` / `<optional>` placeholders.

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Minor Changes

- 3f36a64: Add System Dependencies plugin

  Introduces the system dependencies feature with three new core plugins and
  extends the catalog with a new SystemEditorSlot extension point.

  **New plugins:**

  - **dependency-common**: Shared Zod schemas, RPC contract with resource-level access control, signal definitions, and routes
  - **dependency-backend**: Drizzle schema, DependencyService with cycle detection, WarningEvaluationService with transitive impact matrix, RPC router with signal broadcasting, and per-user canvas node position persistence
  - **dependency-frontend**: DependencyBadge (dashboard), DependencyAlert (system details), DependencyEditor (system editor dialog), and interactive DependencyMapPage (React Flow canvas)

  **Catalog extensions:**

  - **catalog-common**: New `SystemEditorSlot` for plugin-injected sections in the system editor dialog
  - **catalog-frontend**: `SystemEditor` renders the slot after TeamAccessEditor for existing systems

  **Key capabilities:**

  - Directional dependency edges between systems (source depends on target)
  - Three impact types: informational, degraded, critical
  - Transitive multi-hop warning propagation with toggle switch
  - Cycle detection at creation time with graphical chain visualization
  - Health check-level dependency rules
  - Interactive dependency map with drag-to-connect, edge click editor, and auto-saving node positions
  - Inline editing of dependencies in both the system editor and the map canvas
  - Team-based resource-level access control on all mutation endpoints
  - Realtime signal-driven UI updates
