### Minor Changes

- d2077bd: Platform-wide team-scoped access control on a unified relation-tuple store.

  Admins can scope any resource to teams, and the **platform** (not each plugin)
  enforces it. A plugin opts in declaratively by adding `instanceAccess` to a
  procedure's contract; the auth middleware does the rest, so enforcement is
  consistent across catalog, health checks, incidents, maintenances, SLOs,
  automations, and the dependency map, and any third-party plugin gets it for free.

  Core model:

  - **Teams are optional.** A resource with no team grants behaves exactly as
    before.
  - **Team grants are additive and restrict who can CHANGE a resource, not who can
    SEE it.** Granting a team `Manage` lets its members view and change the
    resource; `Read-only` lets them view it. Either level grants access to team
    members **even when they lack the global permission**, and granting never
    removes read from anyone who already had it (e.g. a public status page stays
    readable). Privacy is a separate, explicit opt-in via the **Private** toggle,
    which removes the global read path so only the resource's teams can see it.
  - **Ownership at creation.** Create forms expose an **Owning team** picker. A
    non-admin can create a resource for a team they belong to that holds a
    create-capability grant for that type; the new resource is auto-granted to that
    team. Incidents and maintenances are **parent-gated**: anyone who can manage a
    system may open incidents/maintenances for it, no separate grant needed.
  - **Meaningful authorization errors.** A caller with neither the global rule nor
    any team grant for a resource type gets a `403` with a structured body instead
    of a silently-empty `200`. Anonymous callers on public endpoints are never
    `403`'d, so status pages keep rendering.

  Unified relation-tuple store:

  - The previously separate access primitives (`resource_team_access.canRead` /
    `.canManage`, ownership, `resource_access_settings.teamOnly`, and
    `resource_create_grant`) are collapsed onto ONE
    `relation_tuple(object, relation, subject)` store: "a team has
    `viewer`/`editor`/`owner` on an object, or `creator` on a type". Privacy is an
    explicit **`private` marker** tuple — its **presence** closes the global read
    path (team grants only), its **absence** is the readable-by-default state, so a
    private resource with zero grants is correctly inaccessible to everyone rather
    than silently globalized. The access decision is a pure, unit-tested function.
  - The auth API is generic: `writeRelation` / `removeRelation` / `setObjectPublic`
    / `listObjectRelations` / `listSubjectRelations` / `setCreateGrant` /
    `listTeamCreateGrants` (user-facing) and `check` / `listAccessibleObjectIds` /
    `hasAnyTypeGrant` / `authorizeCreate` / `setOwner` / `deleteObjectRelations`
    (service-to-service). Migration `0008` backfills tuples from the legacy tables
    and drops them.

  Explicit per-procedure scoping:

  - Access rules (`access()` / `accessPair()`) define only the rule (id, level,
    defaults); every procedure declares its own `instanceAccess`. This removes a
    "loaded gun" default that silently applied a shared `idParam` to any procedure
    which forgot its own override.
  - Modes: `idParam` (single-resource pre-check, fails **closed** if the id does
    not resolve), `listKey` / `recordKey` (post-filter a list/record to the
    accessible subset), `create` (authorize creation + write the owning-team
    grant), `parentScope` (scope by read/manage access to a PARENT type,
    cross-plugin single-hop: "you may see incidents/maintenances/SLOs/health for
    system S iff you may see S"), and `global: true` (the honest "intentionally not
    team-scoped" opt-out). A boot-time validator **rejects** any procedure gated on
    a team-scopable resource type that declares no `instanceAccess`, turning the
    previous fail-open into a boot error.

  Teams administration:

  - **Team managers** manage their own team's members and managers without the
    global `auth.teams.manage` rule; creating, deleting, and granting a team access
    remain admin-only.
  - A **standalone Teams page** (gated on `auth.teams.read`) lets managers reach
    team administration without the admin Auth Settings page; members are added via
    a debounced directory picker.
  - A **cross-plugin `ResourceResolverRegistry`** lets owning plugins register a
    name/search resolver for their resource types, so the Teams page lists a team's
    grants **by name** (grouped by type) and offers a resource picker — an admin can
    change a grant's level, revoke it, or add one, without auth depending on every
    plugin. Resolvers shipped for catalog systems, health-check configurations,
    incidents, maintenances, SLO objectives, and automations.

  Frontend:

  - The resource-side editor is **"Who can change this"** (one Manage checkbox per
    team; unticked = read-only), with an always-visible **Private** toggle
    (disabled until a team that can Manage exists, so a resource can't be stranded).
  - `TeamOwnershipPicker` explains _why_ there's nothing to pick (not a member of
    any team, or none of your teams manage the selected parent) instead of a bare
    "global resource" line.
  - Read-only **"who can change this"** indicators on resource detail pages expand
    to the actual people by name; bulk + per-row **Scope to team** actions in the
    catalog systems list; and the team-access copy spells out that grants are
    additive and that Read-only grants view (not change) even without the global
    permission.

  Security hardening:

  - Child deletes in catalog (`removeSystemContact` / `removeSystemLink`) are scoped
    to both the child id and its parent `systemId`, closing a cross-system IDOR for
    team-scoped managers.
  - `searchUsers` is restricted to team administrators, closing a directory/email
    enumeration path opened by the default `auth.teams.read` rule.
  - Grant setters reject unregistered resource types.

  BREAKING CHANGES (beta; shipped as minor bumps):

  - `access()` and `accessPair()` no longer accept `idParam` / `listKey` /
    `recordKey`; move instance config to the procedure's `instanceAccess`.
  - Boot fails if a procedure gated on a team-scopable resource type omits
    `instanceAccess`. Declare a scoping mode or `instanceAccess: { global: true }`.
  - The `AuthService` interface is reshaped: `check`, `listAccessibleObjectIds`,
    `hasAnyTypeGrant`, `authorizeCreate` (returns `isPrivate`), `setOwner`
    (`isPrivate`), and `deleteObjectRelations`. Custom `AuthService` implementations
    and mocks must update.
  - The auth RPC contract's per-concept resource-access endpoints are replaced by
    the generic tuple API above; external callers of the old
    `getResourceTeamAccess` / `setResourceTeamAccess` / `setResourceAccessSettings`
    / `grantResourceCreate` / etc. must move to the new procedures.
  - Several contract inputs changed from a bare `string` to an object so the
    middleware can resolve the resource id: catalog `deleteSystem` (`{ id }`),
    `removeSystemContact` / `removeSystemLink` (`{ id, systemId }`); health-check
    `deleteConfiguration` / `pauseConfiguration` / `resumeConfiguration` (`{ id }`).
    All in-tree callers are updated.
  - List/record endpoints that relied on returning an empty `200` to signal "no
    access" now return a `403` for categorically-unauthorized principals.
  - The mis-keyed bulk endpoints `getBulkIncidentsForSystems`,
    `getBulkMaintenancesForSystems`, and `getBulkObjectivesForSystems` no longer
    post-filter their (systemId-keyed) result; access is already gated by
    `catalog.system` upstream.
  - Team membership/manager mutations (`addUserToTeam`, `removeUserFromTeam`,
    `addTeamManager`, `removeTeamManager`) now require `auth.teams.read` instead of
    `auth.teams.manage` at the contract level (broadened to per-team managers).
  - The `resource_team_access`, `resource_access_settings`, and
    `resource_create_grant` tables are dropped (data backfilled into
    `relation_tuple` by migration `0008`). A previously inconsistent "team-only with
    zero grants" resource is now correctly inaccessible to global-access holders.

- 5c6393f: Add operator-built public Status Pages (phase 1: secure, extensible core).

  Operators compose a public status page from widgets (status banner, system
  health, group status, 90-day uptime, incidents, scheduled maintenance) plus
  content blocks (text/Markdown, heading, links, image, divider), each bound to the
  resources they choose, then publish it.

  Security model — "only published widgets reveal data":

  - A single public endpoint, `getPublishedStatusPage(slug)`, returns the layout
    plus each widget's already-resolved, field-ALLOW-LISTED DTO. The public surface
    has no generic data API, so it can only ever show what was placed on the page.
  - Three gates: edit-time (you can only bind resources you can access), publish-time
    (an audited, deliberate exposure that re-checks the editor can read every bound
    resource via a user-scoped client), and render-time (resolvers run as a trusted
    service but emit only DTO fields — never internal config, ids, or `createdBy`;
    the service re-validates each DTO against its schema, so a resolver bug fails
    closed).
  - The overall banner rolls up only the bound systems; private resources are never
    exposed beyond their public-safe status; per-binding label overrides avoid
    internal-name leaks.

  Coherence + extensibility:

  - Status pages are team-scopable resources (RLAC): created via the standard
    owning-team picker + create-capability flow, resolvable by name in the Teams
    admin.
  - Widget types come from an extension-point registry, so any plugin can contribute
    a widget (config schema + public DTO + `resolvePublic`); the public renderers
    are pure, prop-only components with no data access, so third-party widgets can
    never leak.
  - Draft vs published layouts; per-page visibility (public / authenticated-only)
    and theming (brand color, logo).

  Dependency direction: the status-page platform owns the widget-type registry and
  the content widgets, but the DOMAIN widgets are contributed by their owning
  plugins via the `statusWidgetTypeExtensionPoint` — system health / uptime /
  banner / group status by `healthcheck-backend`, incidents by `incident-backend`,
  scheduled maintenance by `maintenance-backend`. So `status-page-backend` depends
  only on `backend-api` / `common` / `status-page-common`; the owning plugins
  depend on the platform, never the reverse. `catalog-common` gains
  `assertCatalogResourcesReadable` for the publish-time access check.

  Phase 1 scope: the secure core, the admin builder, and the public page (served as
  a no-access-rule route). A fully separate public bundle, custom domains + TLS,
  drag-reorder, live-data preview, and distribution (embeds/badges/RSS/subscriptions)
  are the next phases.

### Patch Changes

- 56e7c75: Hide navigation, actions and links that the current user cannot use, so anonymous
  and read-only users no longer see entries that lead to "Access Denied" or to
  actions the server would reject.

  - **Sidebar**: a nav entry can now declare a dynamic `nav.isVisible({ accessRules, isAuthenticated })` predicate (in addition to the static `accessRule`). A group whose every entry is filtered out is no longer rendered. The filtering/grouping logic is extracted to a pure, unit-tested helper.
  - **Infrastructure**: its sidebar entry is shown only when the user can READ at least one contributed tab (queue, cache, …), instead of always (it previously had no static rule because tabs are contributed at runtime).
  - **Notification Settings**: hidden from anonymous users - notifications are per-user, so an anonymous visitor can't have any.
  - **Anomaly Mute / Suppress**: the "Mute" / "Mute all" controls (a per-user preference) are hidden from anonymous visitors; the "Suppress" control is gated on `anomalyAccess.feed.manage`. Both were previously always visible.
  - **Dashboard**: the "Open Catalog" actions (which open the manage-only Catalog config page) are hidden from users without `catalogAccess.system.manage`, and the "View catalog" link is gated on `catalogAccess.system.read`.
  - **Dashboard status signals**: the per-system status rows contributed by plugins (`SystemSignalsSlot`) now render as a LINK only when the user can open the target, and as plain text otherwise. `SystemSignal` gains an optional `accessRule`; the healthcheck, anomaly, and dependency fillers set it for their gated targets (check-history / assignments / dependency-map). Signals pointing at ungated pages (incident / maintenance / SLO detail) stay links.
  - **Plugin Manager**: the "Install plugin" button (which opens the install-gated page) is hidden from users with only `plugin` view access.
  - **Satellites**: the page is entirely manage-gated, but its route/sidebar entry was gated on `read`, so read-only users saw the nav item and hit "Access Denied" on click. The route and nav entry now require `satellite.manage`.

  The `@checkstack/ai-backend` bump is only the regenerated bundled docs index
  (the frontend routing guide gained the `nav.isVisible` section); no code change.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/frontend-api`):** the `AccessApi` interface gains a
  required `useIsAuthenticated()` method. Custom `AccessApi` implementations must
  add it (it returns `{ loading, isAuthenticated }`). The built-in auth
  implementation and the no-auth fallback already do. `NavEntry` also gains an
  optional `isVisible` predicate (purely additive).

- 56e7c75: Fix frontend access checks to use FULLY-QUALIFIED access-rule ids, and resolve
  the anonymous role on the frontend.

  Granted access-rule ids are stored fully-qualified as `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` (e.g.
  `incident.incident.read`) so two plugins defining the same short rule id never
  collide. The frontend, however, was checking the UNqualified id (`incident.read`)
  via `isAccessRuleSatisfied`, so every check failed for any user without the `*`
  (admin) grant - masked in development because dev-auth grants `*`. This silently
  broke ALL non-admin frontend gating (route guards, sidebar entries, and
  `useAccess`-based button/link gating).

  - **`@checkstack/common`**: `AccessRule` now carries a REQUIRED owning `pluginId`;
    `access()` / `accessPair()` require and stamp it; `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
    qualifies the rule (`{pluginId}.{id}`, plus the manage->read escalation) and
    matches ONLY the qualified form. There is intentionally NO unqualified fallback
    - matching a bare id would let one plugin's grant satisfy another plugin's
      identically-named rule (a cross-plugin privilege-escalation flaw). Every plugin
      that defines access rules now passes its own `pluginId`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend`**: `pluginManager.getAllAccessRules()` no longer strips
    the `pluginId` field (the rule `id` is already fully-qualified for the DB sync).
  - **Route guard** (`@checkstack/frontend` / `@checkstack/frontend-api`) now
    checks the FULL rule object (so it qualifies and escalates), not a bare id.
  - **Anonymous role on the frontend**: the `accessRules` procedure is now
    `public`, returning the configurable anonymous role's grants to unauthenticated
    callers; `useAccessRules` fetches them for guests instead of returning an empty
    set. So anonymous UI now reflects exactly what the anonymous role is allowed -
    which an admin can change (`isPublic` is only the seeded default).
  - Incident / maintenance / SLO detail routes are now read-gated (their read rule
    is an `isPublic` default, so the anonymous role holds it unless an admin
    revokes it); their dashboard status signals carry that rule and render as a
    link only when the viewer may open it.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/common`):** `AccessRule.pluginId` is now REQUIRED, and
  `access()` / `accessPair()` require a `pluginId` option. `isAccessRuleSatisfied`
  matches ONLY the fully-qualified `{pluginId}.{ruleId}` form - the previous
  unqualified fallback is removed, because it was a cross-plugin
  privilege-escalation flaw. Any code constructing an `AccessRule` or calling
  `access()`/`accessPair()` must supply the owning `pluginId`.

  Verified live against an anonymous caller: read pages resolve (qualified match),
  manage actions are denied, manage->read escalation and `*` still work.

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Redesign the catalog into a group-first browse view and tabbed management tables, with inline health rollups.

  - Browse view: the catalog home is a real read-only, scale-built experience - collapsible group sections (with member counts) plus a synthetic Ungrouped section, a shared toolbar (search, group/health/tag filters, density toggle), URL-backed view state (shareable deep links), polished empty states, and a manager-only "Manage catalog" link. Per-system status badges render through the existing `SystemStateBadgesSlot`; filtering is client-side over the loaded set.
  - Management: redesigned as tabbed data tables (Systems / Groups / Environments) replacing the two-column drag-to-assign layout. Systems get multi-select + a bulk bar, inline health, and group + environment membership as removable chips with type-ahead pickers (portaled so they are never clipped); Groups get inline rename and member chips; Environments get a name / members / field-count table (CRUD gated by `catalog.environment.manage`). GitOps-locked rows stay read-only. Drag-and-drop (and `@dnd-kit` on this page) is removed; the management page also shares the browse toolbar.
  - Inline health rollups: a new platform contract `CatalogBrowseHealthSlot` (`@checkstack/catalog-common`) - an additive optional slot catalog-frontend only consumes (a headless data boundary feeding group rollups + the health filter), with a catalog-owned `CatalogHealthStatus` vocabulary so catalog gains no health-plugin dependency. Group headers show a rollup pill derived from the reported status DATA (a system absent from the map is `"unknown"`, never healthy); all-healthy groups start collapsed. The health filter is wired on both toolbars and enables once a filler reports. healthcheck-frontend fills the slot by reusing dashboard-frontend's `SystemBadgeDataProvider`. When no health source is installed the slot is unfilled and the catalog stays fully functional.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Redesign the dashboard as an extensible "needs attention" overview, and normalize system state badges.

  The dashboard now surfaces ONLY systems that need attention (degraded, unhealthy, breaching/at-risk SLO, under an incident or active maintenance, anomalous, or with a dependency problem) and hides everything healthy. A compact header summarises fleet health and filters by severity; each problem renders as an elevated card with one row per issue that deep-links to where the issue originates. A calm "all clear" state shows when nothing needs attention, a live "recent activity" feed sits below, and a "View catalog" link replaces the duplicated system list.

  New platform contract `SystemSignalsSlot` (`@checkstack/catalog-common`): a headless, render-once slot where any plugin bulk-fetches and reports structured `SystemSignal[]` per system via `onSignals(sourceId, map)`. The dashboard aggregates every source agnostic to which plugins contribute; each core reliability plugin (healthcheck, incident, SLO, maintenance, anomaly, dependency) ships a filler, and third-party plugins add new per-system state the same way with no dashboard change. Signals carry an `iconName` rendered via `DynamicIcon` so the contract stays React-free. The dashboard's old summary tiles and overview sheets are removed, so it no longer depends on those plugins' packages. The group "subscribe" control moved onto the catalog browse page's group headers.

  System state badges are normalized into one icon-only `@checkstack/ui` `StatusBadge` primitive - a small tinted icon chip with the full label on hover/focus (and via `aria-label`). Each signal uses its feature's navbar icon (health = Activity, incident = AlertTriangle, SLO = Target, maintenance = Wrench, dependency = GitBranch; anomaly = ChartSpline). Badges self-sort by severity via CSS `order` (error -> warn -> info), tooltips are scoped to a named group, and in catalog browse rows the cluster moved to the right edge.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Add environments as a first-class catalog primitive, with per-environment health-check fan-out, config templating, per-environment reactive health, and script run-context exposure.

  - Catalog primitive: an environment is a sibling of groups - a named, instance-global record carrying free-form custom fields (baseUrl, region, tier, ...) that any system can belong to many-to-many. New `environments` + `systems_environments` tables, `EnvironmentSchema` + create/update schemas, `EntityService` environment CRUD and membership joins, RPC endpoints gated by a new `catalogAccess.environment` access rule, a GitOps `Environment` kind + `System.environments` extension, and frontend management (an `EnvironmentEditor`, an Environments management panel, and a per-system environment picker). The Environments card's Add/Edit/Delete affordances are gated on `catalogAccess.environment.manage`.
  - Per-environment fan-out: run identity becomes `(systemId, configurationId, environmentId)`. Runs, aggregates, and state transitions gain a nullable `environmentId`. The health-check assignment gains an `environmentIds` selector with three modes (All / Specific / None; `null` and `[]` are distinct). The queue executor resolves the effective environment set via the catalog `resolveSystemEnvironments` read and executes one isolated run per environment.
  - Config templating: a new `x-templatable` config-field marker renders a string field through the template engine at execute time, against `{ environment, check, system }`. A shared `renderTemplatableConfig` and a `renderTemplatePreview` helper (re-exported from `@checkstack/template-engine`) keep editor previews identical to the run-time render. The HTTP collector's `url`, `headers[].value`, and `body` are templatable, rendered per environment (the strategy client build moves inside the per-env loop); the `url`'s `.url()` validation moves post-render. Secrets resolve before templating; a field marked both secret and `x-templatable` is rejected at plugin load. `DynamicForm` shows a live "Preview" line, and the catalog `EnvironmentPreviewPicker` ("Preview as: <environment>") drives it in the collector editor (only when the schema has a templatable field).
  - Script run-context: `CollectorRunContext` gains an optional `environment` field (`{ id, name, fields }`, metadata only). Shell collectors receive `CHECKSTACK_ENV_ID` / `_NAME` / `CHECKSTACK_ENV_<FIELD>` vars; inline TS collectors read `globalThis.context.environment`; the editor test panel mirrors both. The env-less path is unchanged.
  - Per-environment reactive health (see BREAKING below), env-keyed read/write paths, env-qualified serialization locks, an optional `trigger.payload.environmentId`, per-environment isolation, and an `ENVIRONMENT_RESOLUTION_FAILED` signal when catalog resolution degrades to a single env-less run.

  BREAKING CHANGES: the reactive `health` entity's id-shape and cardinality change. It now encodes two views: per-environment (id `"<systemId>::<environmentId>"`) and a system rollup (id `"<systemId>"`, the worst status across environments + env-less runs). The rollup PRESERVES the pre-existing system-level contract - dashboards, status badges, and automations referencing health by `systemId` keep working without re-authoring - but the entity's contract surface changed (new id-shape, higher cardinality, new payload field), so it is flagged breaking. `getBulkHealthState` parses env-qualified ids and keys results by the original id.

  State and scale: membership and custom fields live only in catalog Postgres and are re-read every tick via the cross-plugin RPC; env-keyed health reads from shared `health_check_runs` / aggregates / transitions (compute-on-read). Every pod resolves the same effective set and the same per-environment health. No pod-local environment state.

  Also: `unwrapSchema` in `zod-config.ts` loops instead of single-pass-stripping so multi-layer wrappers (`.optional().default()`) still resolve `x-templatable` meta. The env-less `{{ environment.* }}` run notice logs at `debug` (a legitimate recurring configuration), while the post-render HTTP `.url()` check still fails a genuinely-broken empty render with a clear "Rendered URL is invalid" error.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Input-validation and error-mapping hardening found by a fuzzing pass against the built container.

  - backend: a Postgres driver error caused by bad client input no longer surfaces as a `500`. The `/api` and `/rest` dispatchers now map the relevant SQLSTATE classes to the correct status - `22P02`/`22003`/`22001`/`22007` (malformed/out-of-range/over-long/bad-date value), `23502`/`23503`/`23514` (missing/dangling/check-failed) to `400`, and `23505` (unique violation) to `409` - and log them at `warn` (client mistake), not `error`. The client-facing message is generic so column/constraint names are never leaked; genuine unknown faults still log at `error` and 500. Previously a `where id = $1` with a non-uuid `$1` (or an over-long string, or a foreign-key miss in `addSystemToGroup`) reached the driver and 500'd, making routine probing look like a server outage and burying real 500s.
  - slo-common: **fixes a stored cluster-wide DoS.** `windowDays` was accepted up to `2^53`, but the SLO engine derives window boundaries with `Date(now - windowDays * 86_400_000)` - a large value overflows past the max representable `Date` and yields `Invalid Date`. That objective committed fine, then every subsequent read of the system's objectives threw `RangeError: Invalid time value` during serialization (a 500 readable by anyone with SLO read access, on any pod). `windowDays` is now bounded to 1..3650 days at the contract, the GitOps `kind: SLO` spec, and the update path via a single shared `SloWindowDaysSchema`, so the poison row can never be created.
  - slo-common + healthcheck-common: SLO `getDailySnapshots` and the healthcheck history endpoints (`getHistory`, `getDetailedHistory`, `getAggregatedHistory`, `getDetailedAggregatedHistory`, `getRunsForAnalysis`) declared their `startDate`/`endDate` params as `z.date()`, which a `/rest/...` string param can never satisfy - so those endpoints 400'd on the entire REST surface. They now use `z.coerce.date()`, accepting both the REST string shape and the native RPC `Date`.
  - healthcheck-common: `intervalSeconds` was `z.number().min(1)` with no `.int()` and no upper bound, so a fractional or out-of-range value reached the DB and failed at insert (the column is a 32-bit int). It is now `.int().min(1).max(2_592_000)` (1 second .. 30 days), applied to both create and update (the update schema is the create partial).
  - catalog-common: system/group/environment names were bare `z.string()` (environment was `.min(1)` only), so empty, whitespace-only, and 100KB+ names reached the DB - the huge ones surfaced as 500s when parameter binding blew up. Names are now `trim().min(1).max(200)` via a shared schema.

    **BREAKING:** `getSystemContacts` is now `userType: "authenticated"` (was `"public"`). System contacts carry PII (user id, name, email); the public read leaked them to anonymous status-page visitors. Anonymous callers now receive `401` for this one endpoint; the system detail page already renders "No contacts assigned" for anonymous viewers, so the UI degrades gracefully. All other catalog reads remain public.

  - catalog-frontend: the system detail page skips the `getSystemContacts` request entirely for anonymous viewers (it would now `401`) and falls back to the empty state.

  This is a beta release: the breaking contact-visibility change ships as a minor bump per the beta versioning policy, not a major.

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

### Minor Changes

- 9016526: Add a `/rest/:pluginId/*` HTTP mount that serves every plugin's oRPC contract
  through the REST/OpenAPI shape described by `/api/openapi.json`. Queries are
  `GET` with query parameters, mutations are `POST` with the input as the raw
  JSON body. The existing `/api/:pluginId/*` mount continues to serve oRPC's
  native wire protocol unchanged, so existing clients are not affected.

  The OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json` now reflects the real mount: every
  `paths` entry is prefixed with `/rest` instead of `/api`.

  Also fixes a SPA-fallback bug: the backend's `/api-docs` route previously
  returned 404 on production deployments because the static-file middleware
  skipped any path starting with `/api`, capturing `/api-docs` along with real
  API routes. The skip now requires a trailing slash (`/api/`, `/rest/`).

  Required access rules are now visible in the API Docs UI. The OpenAPI spec
  generator was reading a non-existent `accessRules` field on procedure
  metadata; the real field is `access: AccessRule[]`. Each procedure's access
  rules are now flattened to fully-qualified IDs (e.g. `catalog.system.read`)
  and emitted under `x-orpc-meta.accessRules`, which the existing
  `Required Access Rules` section in the docs UI already knew how to render.

  The API Docs schema renderer now handles record types (zod `z.record`),
  `$ref`s into `components.schemas`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, nullable union
  types (`type: ["string", "null"]`), and `format` qualifiers. Previously
  record outputs like `{ statuses: object }` masked the actual value type;
  they now render as `{ [key]: <ResolvedType> { ... } }` with the inner
  schema expanded, capped at 12 levels with cycle detection.

  **REST method conventions.** `proc()` now defaults to `GET` for queries and
  `POST` for mutations on the `/rest` mount, using bracket-notation query
  params (`?filter[status]=active&ids[0]=a`) for GET inputs. Existing
  procedures were updated to follow REST semantics:

  - `update*` mutations → `PATCH`
  - `delete*` / `remove*` mutations → `DELETE`
  - `getBulk*` queries and any query taking a large array input → `POST`
    (because `@orpc/openapi@1.13.x` has no GET→POST URL-length fallback)

  GET endpoints require an `object` input — bare scalars like
  `.input(z.string())` are not valid on GET. `getSystemConfigurations` was
  refactored from `.input(z.string())` to `.input(z.object({ systemId: ... }))`
  to fit the GET shape; the only call-site update was the in-process router
  unpacking `input.systemId` instead of passing `input` directly.

  The API Docs UI now renders query parameters (path/query/header/cookie) in a
  dedicated table for GET endpoints, and the fetch example shows them in the
  URL with `<required>` / `<optional>` placeholders.

### Minor Changes

- 1ef2e79: feat: hotlinks on incidents/maintenances and additional links on systems

  Users with `manage` access on an incident, maintenance, or system can now
  attach free-form URL "hotlinks" — Jira tickets, runbooks, dashboards, ticket
  tools, etc. — alongside the existing fields.

  - **Incidents** & **maintenances**: links live on the entity itself and are
    surfaced both in the editor dialog and on the public detail page. Two new
    RPC procedures per plugin (`addLink`, `removeLink`) gated behind the
    existing `manage` access rule. Links are returned as part of
    `getIncident` / `getMaintenance` and cache-invalidated on every link
    mutation.
  - **Systems**: a parallel `system_links` table with `getSystemLinks`,
    `addSystemLink`, `removeSystemLink` procedures. Surfaced inside the
    system editor (next to contacts) and on the read-only system detail
    sidebar. Cache-scoped per-system so list endpoints remain hot.
  - **Shared UI**: a `LinksEditor` component in `@checkstack/ui` does the
    presentation; the three plugins each own their own RPC wiring.

  Database changes ship as additive migrations (new `incident_links`,
  `maintenance_links`, `system_links` tables, all FK-cascaded on parent
  delete). No existing columns or rows are touched.

  The system incident and maintenance history pages now sort by relevance:
  active entries (non-`resolved` incidents, `scheduled` or `in_progress`
  maintenances) appear at the top, with creation date descending as the
  tiebreaker.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Major Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: Bulk notifications affecting multiple systems and collapse lifecycle events into a single card.

  Notifications now carry an optional `subjects` array (the entities they affect) and an optional `collapseKey` (so related notifications collapse into one row per recipient). Incidents, maintenances, anomalies, healthchecks, and dependency-impact events route through these new fields, so an incident affecting three systems produces one in-app notification + one external send per subscriber instead of three. Lifecycle updates for the same entity (created → updated → resolved) also collapse, with an expandable "+N updates" timeline.

  Subject kinds are namespaced as `<pluginId>.<localKind>` and built via type-safe helpers exported from each domain's common package (`createSystemSubject`, `incidentCollapseKey`, etc.). The frontend kind registry (`registerSubjectKind`) lets plugins bind icon + label for their kinds; unknown kinds fall back to a generic chip.

  All notification strategies (SMTP, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webex, Backstage) render the affected subjects natively in their format (HTML cards, Slack blocks, Discord embed fields, adaptive cards, markdown lists, etc.).

- 32d52c6: feat: unified notification-subscription manager dialog driven by spec registry

  Replaces the bell-toggle UX (which only managed a single legacy
  catalog group) with a modal that lists every notification type
  registered against a target — system or group — and exposes both
  per-type toggles and a bulk "Subscribe to all / Unsubscribe from all"
  action. Both surfaces (system detail page header bell, dashboard group
  header bell) now open the same `NotificationSubscriptionsManager`
  component.

  **Key change vs. the prior slot-based approach**: rows are now driven
  by `notificationClient.listSubscriptionSpecs` — the backend's spec
  registry is the single source of truth. Previously, a row only
  appeared if a frontend plugin had remembered to register a
  `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension`; this caused silent drift
  (healthcheck and dependency registered backend specs without frontend
  extensions, so the dialog counted them but never rendered rows). Now,
  every spec the platform knows about renders a row using the spec's
  `display` metadata (title, description, iconName resolved via
  `DynamicIcon`).

  **Sub-controls registry** (`@checkstack/notification-frontend`):
  plugins that want sub-granularity (anomaly's per-field mute list,
  future severity / channel filters) call
  `registerSubscriptionSubControls(spec, Component)` at module load —
  the manager looks the component up by `specId` when expanding a row.

  **Removed (no compat)**:

  - `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension` (replaced by the
    spec-driven manager + the SubControls registry)
  - `target.slot` field on `NotificationTarget` and the
    `NotificationTargetInput.slot` parameter on
    `defineNotificationTarget`
  - `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot` and
    `GroupNotificationSubscriptionsSlot` from `@checkstack/catalog-common`
  - `SystemNotificationsCard` from the system detail page's main column
  - `SubscribeButton` wiring on dashboard group cards and the system
    detail page header

  **Migrated frontends**: anomaly (now registers `AnomalyFieldMuteList`
  via the SubControls registry), incident, maintenance — all dropped
  their `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension` calls. healthcheck and
  dependency now show up automatically via the spec registry — no
  frontend changes needed for them to render.

  The trigger button reflects aggregate state — filled bell when at
  least one spec is subscribed for the resource, ghost bell when none.

### Minor Changes

- 298bf42: ### Notification System Optimizations

  **System context in notifications**: All notification senders (healthcheck, incident, maintenance, dependency) now include the affected system name in the notification title and body. Users can immediately identify which system is affected without clicking through to the detail page.

  **Upstream notification deduplication**: When an upstream dependency goes down affecting multiple downstream systems, the dependency notification sidecar now sends **one personalized notification per user** instead of one notification per affected system. Each user's notification lists only the systems they are subscribed to, with a link to the upstream root cause system. This prevents notification floods for users subscribed to groups containing many dependent systems.

  **New catalog endpoint**: Added `getSystemGroupIds` S2S RPC endpoint on the catalog to resolve which catalog groups contain a given system, used by the dependency plugin for efficient subscriber resolution during batched notification dispatch.

  - **catalog-common**: Added `instanceAccess` override to contacts RPC endpoints for correct single-resource RLAC checking
  - **ui**: Fixed Tabs component to use `type="button"` to prevent form submission when used inside forms

## 1.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8e43507: BREAKING: `getSystems` now returns `{ systems: [...] }` instead of plain array

  This change enables resource-level access control filtering for the catalog plugin. The middleware needs a consistent object format with named keys to perform post-execution filtering on list endpoints.

  ## Breaking Changes

  - `getSystems()` now returns `{ systems: System[] }` instead of `System[]`
  - All call sites must update to destructure: `const { systems } = await api.getSystems()`

  ## New Features

  - Added `resourceAccess` metadata to catalog endpoints:
    - `getSystems`: List filtering by team access
    - `getSystem`: Single resource pre-check by team access
    - `getEntities`: List filtering for systems by team access

  ## Migration

  ```diff
  - const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  + const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

### Minor Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- 4dd644d: Enable external application (API key) access to management endpoints

  Changed `userType: "user"` to `userType: "authenticated"` for 52 endpoints across 5 packages, allowing external applications (service accounts with API keys) to call these endpoints programmatically while maintaining RBAC permission checks:

  - **incident-common**: createIncident, updateIncident, addUpdate, resolveIncident, deleteIncident
  - **maintenance-common**: createMaintenance, updateMaintenance, addUpdate, closeMaintenance, deleteMaintenance
  - **catalog-common**: System CRUD, Group CRUD, addSystemToGroup, removeSystemFromGroup
  - **healthcheck-common**: Configuration management, system associations, retention config, detailed history
  - **integration-common**: Subscription management, connection management, event discovery, delivery logs

  This enables automation use cases such as:

  - Creating incidents from external monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - Scheduling maintenances from CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing catalog systems from infrastructure-as-code tools
  - Configuring health checks from deployment scripts
