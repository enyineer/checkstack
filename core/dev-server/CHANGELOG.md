# @checkstack/dev-server

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- b627562: Bump direct and transitive dependencies to clear MEDIUM-severity advisories
  that Trivy now surfaces alongside CRITICAL/HIGH.

  Direct version bumps in package.json:

  - `@checkstack/catalog-backend`, `@checkstack/gitops-backend`,
    `@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`: `uuid` `^13.0.0` → `^14.0.0`
    (GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq, missing buffer bounds check in v3/v5/v6). Also
    dropped the now-redundant `@types/uuid` devDependency — uuid 14 ships
    its own types and the npm `@types/uuid` package is a stub.
  - `@checkstack/gitops-backend`: `yaml` `^2.7.0` → `^2.8.3`
    (GHSA-48c2-rrv3-qjmp, stack overflow on deeply nested collections).
  - `@checkstack/dev-server`: `vite` `^5.4.0` → `^8.0.12`
    (GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9, path traversal in optimized-deps `.map` handling)
    and `@vitejs/plugin-react` `^4.3.4` → `^6.0.1` to stay inside the new
    vite peer range.

  Root `overrides` / `resolutions` to bypass transitive pins that block the
  walk:

  - `dompurify` `^3.4.3` — `monaco-editor@0.55.1` pins `dompurify@3.2.7`
    exactly, so the only way to pick up the eight DOMPurify XSS / prototype
    pollution advisories (GHSA-v2wj-7wpq-c8vv et al.) is an override.
    Affects `@checkstack/ui`, which is the only consumer of monaco.
  - `uuid` `^14.0.0` — also forces `bullmq`'s nested `uuid@11.1.0`
    (vulnerable per GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq) to the patched line. Affects
    `@checkstack/queue-bullmq-backend`.
  - `yaml` `^2.9.0` — covers transitive resolutions that would otherwise
    pin pre-2.8.3 yaml.

  The CI image scan (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`) and the local
  `bun run audit:*` helper now include `MEDIUM` alongside `CRITICAL,HIGH`,
  so future MEDIUM regressions fail the pipeline. The production Dockerfile
  also strips vendored `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `benchmark/`,
  `benchmarks/`, `example/` and `examples/` folders from `node_modules`
  before the runtime stage — those tarball artefacts ship their own
  nested `package.json` (`benchmark`, `tedious-benchmarks`, etc.) which
  Trivy was scanning as if they were real packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e90aba5: Split the dev server out of `@checkstack/scripts` into a new
  `@checkstack/dev-server` package.

  **Why**: Previously `@checkstack/scripts` declared `@checkstack/backend`,
  `@checkstack/frontend`, `@checkstack/ui`, `vite`, and
  `@vitejs/plugin-react` as runtime dependencies so the bundled `dev`
  command could spawn a local Checkstack. That made `bunx
@checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` (and any other CLI usage) resolve the
  platform's full transitive dep graph from npm — which broke the
  `Version Packages` release run when one of those transitives
  (`@checkstack/cache-api@0.1.0`) hadn't been published yet, blocking
  plugin-pack validation for 40 plugins.

  **What changed**:

  - New package `@checkstack/dev-server` with the bin `checkstack-dev`. It
    owns the dev loop (backend spawn, Vite, file watcher) and is meant to
    be installed as a `devDependency` in plugin repos.
  - `@checkstack/backend` and `@checkstack/frontend` are _optional_ peer
    dependencies of dev-server; plugin authors only declare the one
    matching their plugin type.
  - `@checkstack/scripts` runtime deps slimmed to `@checkstack/common`,
    `tar`, `inquirer`, `handlebars`. The `dev` command was removed from
    the CLI (it had not shipped to users yet).
  - Plugin scaffolding templates now produce `dev` scripts that call
    `checkstack-dev` directly and add `@checkstack/dev-server` plus the
    matching platform package as devDependencies.
  - Documentation updated to reflect the new dev-loop entry point.

  Both bumps are minor since the project is in beta — the removed `dev`
  command and dropped transitive deps would normally be a major bump.
