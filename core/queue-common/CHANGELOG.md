# @checkstack/queue-common

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- aa89bc5: Replace the bespoke `registerInfrastructureTab()` registry with a standard
  slot-extension contract (`InfrastructureTabsSlot` from
  `@checkstack/infrastructure-common`). Plugins now contribute infrastructure
  tabs via `createSlotExtension`, depending only on the slot owner.

  The slot system in `@checkstack/frontend-api` gains a second type parameter
  on `createSlot<TContext, TMetadata>` so extensions can declare typed static
  metadata at registration time (label, icon, access rules, ordering for the
  infrastructure tab bar). A new `useSlotExtensions(slot)` hook returns typed
  extensions and subscribes to plugin lifecycle changes.

  Each tab body now stacks a **Runtime** sub-section (live state, read-only)
  on top of a **Configuration** sub-section (settings, gated by `canUpdate`).

  **Queue runtime panel.** Surfaces aggregated counts (pending / processing /
  completed / failed) plus three sub-tabs of recent jobs: **Active**, **Recent
  failed** (with the failure message), and **Recent completed** (with
  duration). Job payloads are deliberately not surfaced — they may carry
  secrets and need a separate manage-access gate to be shown.

  To support this, `Queue<T>` gains a required `listJobs(opts)` method
  returning `JobSummary[]` (no payloads), and `QueueStats` gains a
  `scope: "instance" | "cluster"` field. The in-memory queue keeps rolling
  ring buffers (200 entries) for completed/failed history and tracks active
  jobs by id; BullMQ uses native `getJobs`. `QueueManager.listJobs` aggregates
  across queues and sorts (most-recent-first for terminal states, FIFO for
  active/waiting/delayed).

  **Cache runtime panel.** Lists the top N entries by size (or by recency) so
  operators can debug a cache filling up. Values are deliberately omitted —
  PII / secret risk. Backends opt in via an optional `listEntries?` method on
  `CacheProvider`; non-supporting backends return `{ supported: false }` and
  the UI renders a "not supported by this backend" hint. The in-memory cache
  implements it using its existing per-entry byte tracking.

  `CacheStats` also gains `scope: "instance" | "cluster"`.

  **Multi-instance scope warning.** A new `<InstanceScopeBanner>` component in
  `@checkstack/ui` renders a yellow banner above any runtime panel whose
  backend reports `scope: "instance"` — i.e. in-memory queue or cache running
  in a horizontally scaled deployment. The banner explains the metrics are
  local to the responding replica and recommends switching to a clustered
  backend (Redis-backed queue / cache) for cluster-wide visibility.

  **Bug fix — stable cache provider proxy.** `CacheManagerImpl.getProvider()`
  now returns a single stable proxy that delegates to whatever provider is
  currently active. Previously, consumers of `createCachedScope` (and any
  direct `cacheManager.getProvider()` caller) captured the active provider
  reference at plugin-init time. After any `setActiveBackend` call — including
  saving the same memory config in the new Cache tab, which reconstructs the
  in-memory cache — those scopes wrote to an orphaned old provider while the
  runtime panel read stats from the new (empty) one, making the runtime panel
  appear to report 0 keys. With the proxy, all consumers share a single stable
  identity and writes always land in the active provider.

  **Bytes tracking on the in-memory cache.** `InMemoryCache.getStats().sizeBytes`
  now returns a running approximation (UTF-8 bytes of the key plus
  `v8.serialize(value).byteLength`, with a JSON fallback) that's kept in sync
  across all eviction paths. Treat the number as a sanity gauge; it doesn't
  include `Map` per-entry overhead.

  **Pagination.** Both `Queue<T>.listJobs` and `CacheProvider.listEntries?`
  are offset-paginated. Inputs gain an `offset: number`; outputs change to
  `{ items, total: number | null, hasMore: boolean }`. `total` is nullable
  so backends that can't compute it cheaply still paginate via `hasMore`.
  The UI uses the existing `<Pagination>` component with a 25-row default
  page size. `QueueManager.listJobs` aggregates by over-fetching
  `[0, offset+limit)` per queue, merge-sorting, then slicing the window —
  optimal for the single-queue case, acceptable for the multi-queue case
  within the UI's reasonable page-depth bounds. BullMQ uses native offset
  ranges via `getJobs(types, start, end)` plus `getJobCounts` for `total`.

  **Pending tab.** The Queue runtime panel exposes a virtual `"pending"`
  state (waiting ∪ delayed, FIFO). It's now the default sub-tab, since
  "what's queued up?" is the most common question. Per-row state is shown
  when viewing the combined list.

  **Recurring schedules visible under Pending.** Cron- and interval-based
  recurring jobs (e.g. healthchecks) are surfaced under Pending/Delayed
  between fires, with a `nextRunAt` countdown column and a "(recurring)"
  label. `JobSummary` gains optional `nextRunAt: Date` and `recurring:
boolean` fields. The in-memory queue synthesises these rows from its
  `recurringJobs` registry; BullMQ already materialises the next fire of
  each scheduler as a delayed job and we now surface its trigger time and
  the `repeatJobKey`-derived `recurring` flag.

  **Bug fix — drop hook emits with no listeners.** `EventBus.emit` no
  longer enqueues a job when zero listeners (distributed or instance-local)
  are registered for the hook. Previously, hooks like
  `core.plugin.initialized` — emitted on every plugin init but subscribed
  to by nothing in the core repo — accumulated one waiting job per emit
  forever. The in-memory queue's `processNext` short-circuits when there
  are zero consumer groups, so its post-loop cleanup never ran for these
  orphaned jobs. The fix drops the emit at the source and logs a debug
  line. Note: in distributed deployments using a Redis-backed queue, this
  means a subscriber on another replica won't receive an event if no
  replica that emits it has a local listener. Plugins needing cross-process
  delivery must register their listener on every replica that should
  receive the hook.

  **Breaking notes (treated as minor under beta semantics)**:

  - `@checkstack/infrastructure-common` removes `registerInfrastructureTab`
    and `getInfrastructureTabs`; former callers must register an extension
    into `InfrastructureTabsSlot`.
  - `@checkstack/queue-api`'s `Queue<T>` interface requires the new
    `listJobs(opts)` method returning `ListJobsResult` (paginated). Both
    bundled queue backends (memory, BullMQ) are updated; out-of-tree
    implementations will need to add it.
  - `QueueStats` and `CacheStats` add a required `scope` field.
  - `CacheProvider.listEntries?` (when implemented) now returns
    `ListEntriesResult` instead of `CacheEntrySummary[]`.
  - `JobState` adds a `"pending"` variant.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [42abfff]
  - @checkstack/common@0.9.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.2.2

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

- Updated dependencies [50e5f5f]
  - @checkstack/common@0.8.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.2.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

- 180be38: # Queue Lag Warning

  Added a queue lag warning system that displays alerts when pending jobs exceed configurable thresholds.

  ## Features

  - **Backend Stats API**: New `getStats`, `getLagStatus`, and `updateLagThresholds` RPC endpoints
  - **Signal-based Updates**: `QUEUE_LAG_CHANGED` signal for real-time frontend updates
  - **Aggregated Stats**: `QueueManager.getAggregatedStats()` sums stats across all queues

  - **Dashboard Integration**: Queue lag alert displayed on main Dashboard (access-gated)
  - **Queue Settings Page**: Lag alert and Performance Tuning guidance card with concurrency tips

  ## UI Changes

  - New "Performance Tuning" card with concurrency settings guidance and bottleneck indicators

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7a23261]
  - @checkstack/common@0.3.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.1

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates
