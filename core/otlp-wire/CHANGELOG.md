# @checkstack/otlp-wire

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4568dcc: Relocate the pure log/metric parsing and normalization code into the correct
  layers so it can be shared beyond the backends (e.g. by a satellite telemetry
  agent). This is an internal refactor: log-stream and metric-stream behavior is
  unchanged (token formats, HTTP status semantics, buffer/flush timing, parser
  output, ids, and migrations are all byte-identical). The full backend suites -
  unit, integration, and both load guards - pass unchanged, and the `*-common`
  browser-safety guards still pass.

  `@checkstack/otlp-wire` (new foundation leaf, ZERO node builtins so it is safe
  to import from browser-shipped `*-common` packages - enforced by a guard test)
  now owns the dependency-free protobuf wire codec (`ProtoReader` / `ProtoWriter`
  / `WireType`, the depth guard) and the signal-agnostic OTLP structure readers
  (`AnyValue` / `KeyValue` / `Attribute` / `Resource`, `encodeExportServiceResponse`,
  `bytesToHex`), moved out of `@checkstack/ingest-utils`.

  `@checkstack/ingest-utils` (still BACKEND-ONLY) re-exports everything it
  previously exported from `@checkstack/otlp-wire`, so its consumers keep
  compiling unchanged; it now depends on `@checkstack/otlp-wire`.

  `@checkstack/metricstream-common` gains the pure ingest halves, moved from the
  backend and kept browser-safe: the Prometheus text parser, the per-scrape
  max-series shaping (`capScrapeSeries`), OTLP metrics decode (over the
  `@checkstack/otlp-wire` readers), native metrics JSON parse, the OTLP-metrics
  datapoint normalization, and the datapoint timestamp-clamp helper.

  `@checkstack/logstream-common` gains the equivalent pure halves: OTLP logs
  decode/encode, the OTLP-logs and native NDJSON/JSON normalization, the RFC 5424
  syslog parser and the RFC 6587 framer, and the shared severity/attribute/clamp
  normalization helpers.

  `@checkstack/metricstream-backend` and `@checkstack/logstream-backend` now
  import those parsers/normalizers from their `*-common` package instead of
  owning them; the backends keep the endpoints, auth, gzip/body handling,
  buffers/flush, SSRF-guarded scrape fetch executor, and syslog listeners.
