### Minor Changes

- 1ef2e79: feat: hotlinks on incidents/maintenances and additional links on systems

  Users with `manage` access on an incident, maintenance, or system can now
  attach free-form URL "hotlinks" — Jira tickets, runbooks, dashboards, ticket
  tools, etc. — alongside the existing fields.

  - **Incidents** & **maintenances**: links live on the entity itself and are
    surfaced both in the editor dialog and on the public detail page. Two new
    RPC procedures per plugin (`addLink`, `removeLink`) gated behind the
    existing `manage` access rule. Links are returned as part of
    `getIncident` / `getMaintenance` and cache-invalidated on every link
    mutation.
  - **Systems**: a parallel `system_links` table with `getSystemLinks`,
    `addSystemLink`, `removeSystemLink` procedures. Surfaced inside the
    system editor (next to contacts) and on the read-only system detail
    sidebar. Cache-scoped per-system so list endpoints remain hot.
  - **Shared UI**: a `LinksEditor` component in `@checkstack/ui` does the
    presentation; the three plugins each own their own RPC wiring.

  Database changes ship as additive migrations (new `incident_links`,
  `maintenance_links`, `system_links` tables, all FK-cascaded on parent
  delete). No existing columns or rows are touched.

  The system incident and maintenance history pages now sort by relevance:
  active entries (non-`resolved` incidents, `scheduled` or `in_progress`
  maintenances) appear at the top, with creation date descending as the
  tiebreaker.

- 3547670: Wire the new tips infrastructure across the frontends:

  **Empty-state coaching.** Replace generic "no items" copy with onboarding
  guidance — short description, three numbered steps and a primary CTA — on
  every EmptyState that has a meaningful next action. Affects: catalog
  (systems + groups), dashboard, health-check page, integrations (subscriptions

  - provider connections), GitOps providers + secrets, GitOps provenance,
    SLO config + overview, maintenance config, satellites, plugin manager,
    incident config, announcements. Read-only EmptyStates (incident history,
    maintenance history, plugin events) get clearer descriptions explaining
    what would populate them.

  **First-run anchored tips.** Add `<Tip>` popovers to the most important
  "Create" affordances so first-time users see a one-line explanation of
  what they're about to make and why it matters: catalog “Add System” /
  “Add Group”, healthcheck “Create Check”, integrations “New Subscription”,
  GitOps “Add Provider”, SLO “Create SLO”, maintenance “Create Maintenance”,
  satellite “Create Satellite”, plugin-manager “Install plugin”, incident
  “Report Incident”, announcement “New Announcement”. Each tip is dismissed
  per user (server-backed when signed in, localStorage otherwise) and
  namespaced through `qualifyTipId(plugin, …)` so it cannot escape the
  plugin's own namespace.

  **Welcome banner on the dashboard.** A `<TipBanner>` at the top of the
  dashboard introduces Checkstack's main flow ("add a system, then a health
  check") with a one-click jump into the catalog.

### Patch Changes

- 950d6ec: Fix mobile UserMenu items rendering at zero height, group menu items by
  section, and unstack cramped card headers on small viewports.

  - **UserMenu mobile bug**: On mobile, the user-menu Sheet rendered every
    menu item as a grid row, which combined with `flex-shrink: 1` on each
    item collapsed the buttons whose internal layout uses `display: flex`
    (the items registered with `useNavigate` rather than `<Link>`) to zero
    content height. Switched the mobile container to a flex column with
    `[&>*]:shrink-0` and added `min-h-0` so the sheet scrolls correctly
    when the list overflows.

  - **UserMenu grouping**: Slot extensions now accept an optional `group`
    field. The user menu buckets `UserMenuItemsSlot` extensions by `group`
    and renders each group under a labeled header (`Workspace`,
    `Reliability`, `Configuration`, `Documentation`, `Account`). Existing
    core plugins are tagged with the appropriate group; third-party plugins
    can pick any of these or supply their own label. Untagged extensions
    render last with no header. `UserMenuItemsBottomSlot` is unaffected.

  - **Card header responsiveness**: `CardHeaderRow` (the primitive shared by
    Incident, Maintenance, Auth, Catalog, GitOps and other config cards) now
    stacks vertically on narrow viewports and only switches to a single row
    at the `sm` breakpoint, so titles and adjacent filter controls (e.g.
    status `Select`, "Show resolved" checkbox) no longer cram together on
    mobile. Refactored the Incident and Maintenance config pages to use the
    primitive instead of a hand-rolled `flex items-center justify-between`
    row, and made their `Select` triggers full-width on mobile.

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

### Minor Changes

- 32d52c6: feat: unified notification-subscription manager dialog driven by spec registry

  Replaces the bell-toggle UX (which only managed a single legacy
  catalog group) with a modal that lists every notification type
  registered against a target — system or group — and exposes both
  per-type toggles and a bulk "Subscribe to all / Unsubscribe from all"
  action. Both surfaces (system detail page header bell, dashboard group
  header bell) now open the same `NotificationSubscriptionsManager`
  component.

  **Key change vs. the prior slot-based approach**: rows are now driven
  by `notificationClient.listSubscriptionSpecs` — the backend's spec
  registry is the single source of truth. Previously, a row only
  appeared if a frontend plugin had remembered to register a
  `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension`; this caused silent drift
  (healthcheck and dependency registered backend specs without frontend
  extensions, so the dialog counted them but never rendered rows). Now,
  every spec the platform knows about renders a row using the spec's
  `display` metadata (title, description, iconName resolved via
  `DynamicIcon`).

  **Sub-controls registry** (`@checkstack/notification-frontend`):
  plugins that want sub-granularity (anomaly's per-field mute list,
  future severity / channel filters) call
  `registerSubscriptionSubControls(spec, Component)` at module load —
  the manager looks the component up by `specId` when expanding a row.

  **Removed (no compat)**:

  - `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension` (replaced by the
    spec-driven manager + the SubControls registry)
  - `target.slot` field on `NotificationTarget` and the
    `NotificationTargetInput.slot` parameter on
    `defineNotificationTarget`
  - `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot` and
    `GroupNotificationSubscriptionsSlot` from `@checkstack/catalog-common`
  - `SystemNotificationsCard` from the system detail page's main column
  - `SubscribeButton` wiring on dashboard group cards and the system
    detail page header

  **Migrated frontends**: anomaly (now registers `AnomalyFieldMuteList`
  via the SubControls registry), incident, maintenance — all dropped
  their `createNotificationSubscriptionExtension` calls. healthcheck and
  dependency now show up automatically via the spec registry — no
  frontend changes needed for them to render.

  The trigger button reflects aggregate state — filled bell when at
  least one spec is subscribed for the resource, ghost bell when none.

- 32d52c6: feat: notification target pattern + per-spec subscriptions

  Replaces the all-or-nothing catalog system/group notification model with a
  platform-level target pattern. Each notification-emitting plugin declares
  _subscription specs_ against typed _target_ objects exported from the
  target's owning plugin (catalog ships `catalogSystemTarget` and
  `catalogGroupTarget`). Notification-backend handles every per-resource
  group lifecycle, parent-edge inheritance, and legacy-subscription seeding
  — plugins never author groupId helpers, lifecycle hooks, or migration
  code again.

  **Plugin-author surface area is now ~12 lines per emitter:**

  ```ts
  // <plugin>-common
  const { defineSubscription } = createSubscriptionFactory(pluginMetadata);
  export const fooSystemSubscription = defineSubscription({
    localId: "system",
    target: catalogSystemTarget,
    display: { title: "Foo Alerts", description: "...", iconName: "Bell" },
  });

  // <plugin>-backend register()
  env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([fooSystemSubscription]);
  //   ^ feeds the plugin loader's dependency sorter — each spec's
  //     target.ownerPlugin becomes an implicit init-order dep, so this
  //     plugin automatically waits for catalog (the target owner) to
  //     finish init + afterPluginsReady before its own runs.

  // <plugin>-backend afterPluginsReady
  await notificationClient.registerSubscriptionSpec(
    specToRegistration(fooSystemSubscription)
  );
  // dispatch
  await notificationClient.notifyForSubscription({
    specId: fooSystemSubscription.specId,
    resourceKeys: [systemId],
    title,
    body,
    importance,
    action,
    collapseKey,
    subjects,
  });

  // <plugin>-frontend
  createNotificationSubscriptionExtension({ spec: fooSystemSubscription });
  ```

  **Migrated plugins**: anomaly, incident, maintenance, healthcheck,
  dependency. Each lost its bespoke `notification-groups.ts`,
  `bootstrap*NotificationGroups`, `ensure*Group`, and inheritance walk —
  all of that is now centralized in notification-backend's
  `subscription-engine`.

  **Plugin loader change** (`@checkstack/backend-api`,
  `@checkstack/backend`): the register-time API gains
  `env.registerSubscriptionSpecs([...specs])`. The dependency sorter
  walks `spec.target.ownerPlugin` for every declared spec and adds the
  target owner as an init-order dependency of the emitting plugin. This
  guarantees that catalog (the owner of the platform's `system` and
  `group` targets) completes init + afterPluginsReady before any
  emitting plugin tries to register its specs against the notification
  service — no string-prefix heuristics, no manual `dependsOnPlugins`
  list, no stub rows. Plugins that fail to declare their specs at
  register time get a clear `Target type X is not registered. Did the
emitting plugin declare this spec via env.registerSubscriptionSpecs?`
  error from the dispatcher.

  **Removed** (no backwards compat):

  - `catalogClient.notifySystemSubscribers` and
    `catalogClient.notifyManySystemSubscribers`
  - `notificationClient.notifyUsers` and `notificationClient.notifyGroups`
    as direct dispatch primitives — replaced by spec-bound
    `notifyForSubscription`
  - catalog's `bootstrapNotificationGroups` (replaced by
    `bootstrapNotificationTargets`)

  **Enforcement**: the dispatcher rejects calls referencing unregistered
  specIds, specs owned by other plugins, or resourceKeys that haven't been
  pushed via `upsertNotificationResource`. Display metadata for any
  groupId is recoverable via the spec registry, so audit lists render
  correct labels even when an emitter's frontend isn't loaded.

  **Per-field anomaly mute** keeps working — it now lives inside the
  generic SubscriptionRow's optional `SubControls` panel
  (`AnomalyFieldMuteList`), exposed through the catalog system detail
  page's notifications card.

  The catalog system detail page renders a "Notifications" card hosting
  `SystemNotificationSubscriptionsSlot`. The matching group surface is
  not yet rendered — group-level subscriptions are wired end-to-end on
  the backend; a follow-up will add the host UI.

  **Migration of existing subscribers**: target types declare a
  `legacyGroupIdTemplate`; on first registration of each spec,
  notification-backend reads subscribers from the legacy
  `catalog.system.<id>` / `catalog.group.<id>` groups and seeds the new
  spec groups exactly once per (spec × resource) pair, tracked in
  `subscription_migrations`. Anomaly stays opt-in (its target also
  declares the template, but the user-explicit nature of the original
  opt-in flow means the seeding produces the same set of subscribers
  they already had).

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 208ad71: Centralize realtime cache invalidation: signals now carry their owning `pluginId` end-to-end, and a single `SignalAutoInvalidator` mounted near the React Query client invalidates `[[pluginId]]` for every incoming signal automatically.

  **Breaking change to `createSignal`** (`@checkstack/signal-common`): the factory now takes a single object argument with `pluginMetadata`, `event`, and `payloadSchema`. The signal id is constructed as `${pluginMetadata.pluginId}.${event}` and the resulting `Signal` carries a `pluginId` field. The `SignalMessage` wire envelope and `ServerToClientMessage` `signal` variant gained a `pluginId` field so the frontend can route invalidations without parsing the id.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal(
    "anomaly.state_changed",
    z.object({ ... }),
  );

  // After
  export const ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED = createSignal({
    pluginMetadata,
    event: "state_changed",
    payloadSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  });
  ```

  **New plugin field**: `FrontendPlugin.foreignSignals?: Signal<unknown>[]` lets a plugin opt its `[[pluginId]]` cache into invalidation when another plugin's signal fires (e.g. `dependency-frontend` declares `[SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED]` because dependency payloads embed system status). Same-plugin signals must NOT be listed — they are always auto-invalidated.

  **Removed boilerplate**: per-component `useSignal(X, () => refetch())` and `useSignal(X, () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(...))` calls have been removed across `incident-frontend`, `maintenance-frontend`, `healthcheck-frontend`, `slo-frontend`, `dependency-frontend`, `satellite-frontend`, `announcement-frontend`, `notification-frontend`, and `dashboard-frontend`. The `NotificationBell` unread count is now derived directly from the `getUnreadCount` query (auto-invalidated) instead of a local state mirror.

  **User-visible bug fix**: the system detail page anomaly widget (`SystemAnomalyWidget`) now updates in real-time when anomalies change, with no per-widget signal subscription required. The dashboard status page also stays fresh on `ANOMALY_STATE_CHANGED`, `ANOMALY_BASELINE_UPDATED`, and `ANOMALY_TREND_DETECTED`.

  UI-state consumers that legitimately need a `useSignal` (the dashboard activity terminal, the queue lag alert, and the rolling-preset date refresh in `useHealthCheckData`) keep their handlers; the auto-invalidator runs alongside them.

### Patch Changes

- d1a2796: Enforce stricter code quality standards and eliminate AI slop anti-patterns.

  **New utility**

  - `extractErrorMessage(error, fallback?)` in `@checkstack/common` for consistent error extraction

  **ESLint rules**

  - `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps` for hook correctness
  - `no-console` in frontend packages — forces `toast` over silent `console.error`
  - `no-restricted-syntax` banning `instanceof Error` — forces `extractErrorMessage`
  - Custom `no-eslint-disable-any` rule preventing `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` circumvention

  **Refactoring**

  - Replace 141 `instanceof Error` boilerplate patterns across the codebase
  - Replace swallowed `console.error` with user-visible `toast.error()` feedback
  - Remove 15 redundant `as` type casts in IntegrationsPage and ProviderConnectionsPage
  - Consolidate 3 identical callback handlers into `handleDialogClose`
  - Fix conditional React hook call in `FormField.tsx`
  - Fix unstable useMemo deps in `Dashboard.tsx`
  - Replace `useEffect`→`setState` with derived `useMemo` in `RegisterPage.tsx`
  - Rewrite `keystore.test.ts` with typed `DrizzleMockChain` (eliminating 7 `any` suppressions)
  - Delete obvious comments in `encryption.ts` and Teams `provider.ts`

### Patch Changes

- @checkstack/dashboard-frontend@0.3.25

## 0.4.14

### Patch Changes

- 1f191cf: Add SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED signal and dependency-driven notification improvements

  **healthcheck-common:**

  - New `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` signal that fires only on system-level health status transitions (healthy ↔ degraded ↔ unhealthy), providing a low-noise alternative to `HEALTH_CHECK_RUN_COMPLETED` for coarse-grained reactivity

  **healthcheck-backend:**

  - Broadcast `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` signal at both status transition code paths in the queue executor

  **healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Switch `SystemHealthBadge` from `HEALTH_CHECK_RUN_COMPLETED` to `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` to reduce unnecessary refetch noise

  **dashboard-frontend:**

  - Switch `SystemBadgeDataProvider` from `HEALTH_CHECK_RUN_COMPLETED` to `SYSTEM_STATUS_CHANGED` for more efficient badge updates

  **maintenance-frontend:**

  - Clarify that notification suppression toggle also applies to downstream dependency-driven notifications

  **incident-frontend:**

  - Clarify that notification suppression toggle also applies to downstream dependency-driven notifications

### Minor Changes

- 7a23261: ## TanStack Query Integration

  Migrated all frontend components to use `usePluginClient` hook with TanStack Query integration, replacing the legacy `forPlugin()` pattern.

  ### New Features

  - **`usePluginClient` hook**: Provides type-safe access to plugin APIs with `.useQuery()` and `.useMutation()` methods
  - **Automatic request deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same data share a single network request
  - **Built-in caching**: Configurable stale time and cache duration per query
  - **Loading/error states**: TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `error`, `isRefetching` states automatically
  - **Background refetching**: Stale data is automatically refreshed when components mount

  ### Contract Changes

  All RPC contracts now require `operationType: "query"` or `operationType: "mutation"` metadata:

  ```typescript
  const getItems = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "query", access: [access.read] })
    .output(z.array(itemSchema))
    .query();

  const createItem = proc()
    .meta({ operationType: "mutation", access: [access.manage] })
    .input(createItemSchema)
    .output(itemSchema)
    .mutation();
  ```

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (forPlugin pattern)
  const api = useApi(myPluginApiRef);
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    api.getItems().then(setItems);
  }, [api]);

  // After (usePluginClient pattern)
  const client = usePluginClient(MyPluginApi);
  const { data: items, isLoading } = client.getItems.useQuery({});
  ```

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `rpc.test.ts` test setup for middleware type inference
  - Fixed `SearchDialog` to use `setQuery` instead of deprecated `search` method
  - Fixed null→undefined warnings in notification and queue frontends

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [180be38]

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

### Patch Changes

- 97a6a23: Improve incident and maintenance detail page layout consistency and navigation

  **Layout consistency:**

  - Incident detail page now matches maintenance detail page structure
  - Both use PageLayout wrapper with consistent card layout
  - Affected systems moved into main details card with server icons
  - Standardized padding, spacing, and description/date formatting

  **Back navigation with system context:**

  - Detail pages now track source system via `?from=systemId` query parameter
  - "Back to History" navigates to the correct system's history page
  - Works when navigating from system panels, history pages, or system detail page
  - Falls back to first affected system if no query param present

- 32ea706: ### User Menu Loading State Fix

  Fixed user menu items "popping in" one after another due to independent async permission checks.

  **Changes:**

  - Added `UserMenuItemsContext` interface with `permissions` and `hasCredentialAccount` to `@checkstack/frontend-api`
  - `LoginNavbarAction` now pre-fetches all permissions and credential account info before rendering the menu
  - All user menu item components now use the passed context for synchronous permission checks instead of async hooks
  - Uses `qualifyPermissionId` helper for fully-qualified permission IDs

  **Result:** All menu items appear simultaneously when the user menu opens.
