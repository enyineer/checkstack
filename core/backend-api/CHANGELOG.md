  - @checkstack/queue-api@0.0.6

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9faec1f: # Unified AccessRule Terminology Refactoring

  This release completes a comprehensive terminology refactoring from "permission" to "accessRule" across the entire codebase, establishing a consistent and modern access control vocabulary.

  ## Changes

  ### Core Infrastructure (`@checkstack/common`)

  - Introduced `AccessRule` interface as the primary access control type
  - Added `accessPair()` helper for creating read/manage access rule pairs
  - Added `access()` builder for individual access rules
  - Replaced `Permission` type with `AccessRule` throughout

  ### API Changes

  - `env.registerPermissions()` → `env.registerAccessRules()`
  - `meta.permissions` → `meta.access` in RPC contracts
  - `usePermission()` → `useAccess()` in frontend hooks
  - Route `permission:` field → `accessRule:` field

  ### UI Changes

  - "Roles & Permissions" tab → "Roles & Access Rules"
  - "You don't have permission..." → "You don't have access..."
  - All permission-related UI text updated

  ### Documentation & Templates

  - Updated 18 documentation files with AccessRule terminology
  - Updated 7 scaffolding templates with `accessPair()` pattern
  - All code examples use new AccessRule API

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Backend Plugins

  ```diff
  - import { permissionList } from "./permissions";
  - env.registerPermissions(permissionList);
  + import { accessRules } from "./access";
  + env.registerAccessRules(accessRules);
  ```

  ### RPC Contracts

  ```diff
  - .meta({ userType: "user", permissions: [permissions.read.id] })
  + .meta({ userType: "user", access: [access.read] })
  ```

  ### Frontend Hooks

  ```diff
  - const canRead = accessApi.usePermission(permissions.read.id);
  + const canRead = accessApi.useAccess(access.read);
  ```

  ### Routes

  ```diff
  - permission: permissions.entityRead.id,
  + accessRule: access.read,
  ```

- 827b286: Add array assertion operators for string array fields

  New operators for asserting on array fields (e.g., playerNames in RCON collectors):

  - **includes** - Check if array contains a specific value
  - **notIncludes** - Check if array does NOT contain a specific value
  - **lengthEquals** - Check if array length equals a value
  - **lengthGreaterThan** - Check if array length is greater than a value
  - **lengthLessThan** - Check if array length is less than a value
  - **isEmpty** - Check if array is empty
  - **isNotEmpty** - Check if array has at least one element

  Also exports a new `arrayField()` schema factory for creating array assertion schemas.

### Patch Changes

- f533141: Enforce health result factory function usage via branded types

  - Added `healthResultSchema()` builder that enforces the use of factory functions at compile-time
  - Added `healthResultArray()` factory for array fields (e.g., DNS resolved values)
  - Added branded `HealthResultField<T>` type to mark schemas created by factory functions
  - Consolidated `ChartType` and `HealthResultMeta` into `@checkstack/common` as single source of truth
  - Updated all 12 health check strategies and 11 collectors to use `healthResultSchema()`
  - Using raw `z.number()` etc. inside `healthResultSchema()` now causes a TypeScript error

- aa4a8ab: Fix anonymous users not seeing public list endpoints

  Anonymous users with global access rules (e.g., `catalog.system.read` assigned to the "anonymous" role) were incorrectly getting empty results from list endpoints with `instanceAccess.listKey`. The middleware now properly checks if anonymous users have global access before filtering.

  Added comprehensive test suite for `autoAuthMiddleware` covering:

  - Anonymous endpoints (userType: "anonymous")
  - Public endpoints with global and instance-level access rules
  - Authenticated, user-only, and service-only endpoints
  - Single resource access with team-based filtering

- Updated dependencies [9faec1f]
- Updated dependencies [f533141]
  - @checkstack/common@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/queue-api@0.0.5

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e43507: # Teams and Resource-Level Access Control

  This release introduces a comprehensive Teams system for organizing users and controlling access to resources at a granular level.

  ## Features

  ### Team Management

  - Create, update, and delete teams with name and description
  - Add/remove users from teams
  - Designate team managers with elevated privileges
  - View team membership and manager status

  ### Resource-Level Access Control

  - Grant teams access to specific resources (systems, health checks, incidents, maintenances)
  - Configure read-only or manage permissions per team
  - Resource-level "Team Only" mode that restricts access exclusively to team members
  - Separate `resourceAccessSettings` table for resource-level settings (not per-grant)
  - Automatic cleanup of grants when teams are deleted (database cascade)

  ### Middleware Integration

  - Extended `autoAuthMiddleware` to support resource access checks
  - Single-resource pre-handler validation for detail endpoints
  - Automatic list filtering for collection endpoints
  - S2S endpoints for access verification

  ### Frontend Components

  - `TeamsTab` component for managing teams in Auth Settings
  - `TeamAccessEditor` component for assigning team access to resources
  - Resource-level "Team Only" toggle in `TeamAccessEditor`
  - Integration into System, Health Check, Incident, and Maintenance editors

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### API Response Format Changes

  List endpoints now return objects with named keys instead of arrays directly:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const systems = await catalogApi.getSystems();

  // After
  const { systems } = await catalogApi.getSystems();
  ```

  Affected endpoints:

  - `catalog.getSystems` → `{ systems: [...] }`
  - `healthcheck.getConfigurations` → `{ configurations: [...] }`
  - `incident.listIncidents` → `{ incidents: [...] }`
  - `maintenance.listMaintenances` → `{ maintenances: [...] }`

  ### User Identity Enrichment

  `RealUser` and `ApplicationUser` types now include `teamIds: string[]` field with team memberships.

  ## Documentation

  See `docs/backend/teams.md` for complete API reference and integration guide.

### Patch Changes

- 97c5a6b: Fix collector lookup when health check is assigned to a system

  Collectors are now stored in the registry with their fully-qualified ID format (ownerPluginId.collectorId) to match how they are referenced in health check configurations. Added `qualifiedId` field to `RegisteredCollector` interface to avoid re-constructing the ID at query time. This fixes the "Collector not found" warning that occurred when executing health checks with assigned systems.

- Updated dependencies [8e43507]
  - @checkstack/common@0.1.0
  - @checkstack/queue-api@0.0.4
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.4

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f5b1f49: Added collector registry lifecycle cleanup during plugin unloading.

  - Added `unregisterByOwner(pluginId)` to remove collectors owned by unloading plugins
  - Added `unregisterByMissingStrategies(loadedPluginIds)` for dependency-based pruning
  - Integrated registry cleanup into `PluginManager.deregisterPlugin()`
  - Updated `registerCoreServices` to return global registries for lifecycle management

### Patch Changes

- f5b1f49: Added JSONPath assertions for response body validation and fully qualified strategy IDs.

  **JSONPath Assertions:**

  - Added `healthResultJSONPath()` factory in healthcheck-common for fields supporting JSONPath queries
  - Extended AssertionBuilder with jsonpath field type showing path input (e.g., `$.data.status`)
  - Added `jsonPath` field to `CollectorAssertionSchema` for persistence
  - HTTP Request collector body field now supports JSONPath assertions

  **Fully Qualified Strategy IDs:**

  - HealthCheckRegistry now uses scoped factories like CollectorRegistry
  - Strategies are stored with `pluginId.strategyId` format
  - Added `getStrategiesWithMeta()` method to HealthCheckRegistry interface
  - Router returns qualified IDs so frontend can correctly fetch collectors

  **UI Improvements:**

  - Save button disabled when collector configs have invalid required fields
  - Fixed nested button warning in CollectorList accordion

- Updated dependencies [f5b1f49]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.3
  - @checkstack/queue-api@0.0.3
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.3

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- d20d274: Initial release of all @checkstack packages. Rebranded from Checkmate to Checkstack with new npm organization @checkstack and domain checkstack.dev.
- Updated dependencies [d20d274]
  - @checkstack/common@0.0.2
  - @checkstack/queue-api@0.0.2
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.0.2

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a65e002: Add compile-time type safety for Lucide icon names

  - Add `LucideIconName` type and `lucideIconSchema` Zod schema to `@checkstack/common`
  - Update backend interfaces (`AuthStrategy`, `NotificationStrategy`, `IntegrationProvider`, `CommandDefinition`) to use `LucideIconName`
  - Update RPC contracts to use `lucideIconSchema` for proper type inference across RPC boundaries
  - Simplify `SocialProviderButton` to use `DynamicIcon` directly (removes 30+ lines of pascalCase conversion)
  - Replace static `iconMap` in `SearchDialog` with `DynamicIcon` for dynamic icon rendering
  - Add fallback handling in `DynamicIcon` when icon name isn't found
  - Fix legacy kebab-case icon names to PascalCase: `mail`→`Mail`, `send`→`Send`, `github`→`Github`, `key-round`→`KeyRound`, `network`→`Network`, `AlertCircle`→`CircleAlert`

### Patch Changes

- b4eb432: Fixed TypeScript generic contravariance issue in notification strategy registration.

  The `register` and `addStrategy` methods now use generic type parameters instead of `unknown`, allowing notification strategy plugins with typed OAuth configurations to be registered without compiler errors. This fixes contravariance issues where function parameters in `StrategyOAuthConfig<TConfig>` could not be assigned when `TConfig` was a specific type.

- Updated dependencies [a65e002]
  - @checkstack/common@0.2.0
  - @checkstack/queue-api@1.0.1
  - @checkstack/signal-common@0.1.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 81f3f85: ## Breaking: Unified Versioned<T> Architecture

  Refactored the versioning system to use a unified `Versioned<T>` class instead of separate `VersionedSchema`, `VersionedData`, and `VersionedConfig` types.

  ### Breaking Changes

  - **`VersionedSchema<T>`** is replaced by `Versioned<T>` class
  - **`VersionedData<T>`** is replaced by `VersionedRecord<T>` interface
  - **`VersionedConfig<T>`** is replaced by `VersionedPluginRecord<T>` interface
  - **`ConfigMigration<F, T>`** is replaced by `Migration<F, T>` interface
  - **`MigrationChain<T>`** is removed (use `Migration<unknown, unknown>[]`)
  - **`migrateVersionedData()`** is removed (use `versioned.parse()`)
  - **`ConfigMigrationRunner`** is removed (migrations are internal to Versioned)

  ### Migration Guide

  Before:

  ```typescript
  const strategy: HealthCheckStrategy = {
    config: {
      version: 1,
      schema: mySchema,
      migrations: [],
    },
  };
  const data = await migrateVersionedData(stored, 1, migrations);
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  const strategy: HealthCheckStrategy = {
    config: new Versioned({
      version: 1,
      schema: mySchema,
      migrations: [],
    }),
  };
  const data = await strategy.config.parse(stored);
  ```

### Minor Changes

- ffc28f6: ### Anonymous Role and Public Access

  Introduces a configurable "anonymous" role for managing permissions available to unauthenticated users.

  **Core Changes:**

  - Added `userType: "public"` - endpoints accessible by both authenticated users (with their permissions) and anonymous users (with anonymous role permissions)
  - Renamed `userType: "both"` to `"authenticated"` for clarity
  - Renamed `isDefault` to `isAuthenticatedDefault` on Permission interface
  - Added `isPublicDefault` flag for permissions that should be granted to the anonymous role by default

  **Backend Infrastructure:**

  - New `anonymous` system role created during auth-backend initialization
  - New `disabled_public_default_permission` table tracks admin-disabled public defaults
  - `autoAuthMiddleware` now checks anonymous role permissions for unauthenticated public endpoint access
  - `AuthService.getAnonymousPermissions()` with 1-minute caching for performance
  - Anonymous role filtered from `getRoles` endpoint (not assignable to users)
  - Validation prevents assigning anonymous role to users

  **Catalog Integration:**

  - `catalog.read` permission now has both `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Read endpoints (`getSystems`, `getGroups`, `getEntities`) now use `userType: "public"`

  **UI:**

  - New `PermissionGate` component for conditionally rendering content based on permissions

- 71275dd: fix: Anonymous and non-admin user authorization

  - Fixed permission metadata preservation in `plugin-manager.ts` - changed from outdated `isDefault` field to `isAuthenticatedDefault` and `isPublicDefault`
  - Added `pluginId` to `RpcContext` to enable proper permission ID matching
  - Updated `autoAuthMiddleware` to prefix contract permission IDs with the pluginId from context, ensuring that contract permissions (e.g., `catalog.read`) correctly match database permissions (e.g., `catalog-backend.catalog.read`)
  - Route now uses `/api/:pluginId/*` pattern with Hono path parameters for clean pluginId extraction

- ae19ff6: Add configurable state thresholds for health check evaluation

  **@checkstack/backend-api:**

  - Added `VersionedData<T>` generic interface as base for all versioned data structures
  - `VersionedConfig<T>` now extends `VersionedData<T>` and adds `pluginId`
  - Added `migrateVersionedData()` utility function for running migrations on any `VersionedData` subtype

  **@checkstack/backend:**

  - Refactored `ConfigMigrationRunner` to use the new `migrateVersionedData` utility

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-common:**

  - Added state threshold schemas with two evaluation modes (consecutive, window)
  - Added `stateThresholds` field to `AssociateHealthCheckSchema`
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC endpoint contract

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-backend:**

  - Added `stateThresholds` column to `system_health_checks` table
  - Added `state-evaluator.ts` with health status evaluation logic
  - Added `state-thresholds-migrations.ts` with migration infrastructure
  - Added `getSystemHealthStatus` RPC handler

  **@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend:**

  - Updated `SystemHealthBadge` to use new backend endpoint

- b55fae6: Added realtime Signal Service for backend-to-frontend push notifications via WebSockets.

  ## New Packages

  - **@checkstack/signal-common**: Shared types including `Signal`, `SignalService`, `createSignal()`, and WebSocket protocol messages
  - **@checkstack/signal-backend**: `SignalServiceImpl` with EventBus integration and Bun WebSocket handler using native pub/sub
  - **@checkstack/signal-frontend**: React `SignalProvider` and `useSignal()` hook for consuming typed signals

  ## Changes

  - **@checkstack/backend-api**: Added `coreServices.signalService` reference for plugins to emit signals
  - **@checkstack/backend**: Integrated WebSocket server at `/api/signals/ws` with session-based authentication

  ## Usage

  Backend plugins can emit signals:

  ```typescript
  import { coreServices } from "@checkstack/backend-api";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  const signalService = context.signalService;
  await signalService.sendToUser(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, userId, { ... });
  ```

  Frontend components subscribe to signals:

  ```tsx
  import { useSignal } from "@checkstack/signal-frontend";
  import { NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED } from "@checkstack/notification-common";

  useSignal(NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED, (payload) => {
    // Handle realtime notification
  });
  ```

- b354ab3: # Strategy Instructions Support & Telegram Notification Plugin

  ## Strategy Instructions Interface

  Added `adminInstructions` and `userInstructions` optional fields to the `NotificationStrategy` interface. These allow strategies to export markdown-formatted setup guides that are displayed in the configuration UI:

  - **`adminInstructions`**: Shown when admins configure platform-wide strategy settings (e.g., how to create API keys)
  - **`userInstructions`**: Shown when users configure their personal settings (e.g., how to link their account)

  ### Updated Components

  - `StrategyConfigCard` now accepts an `instructions` prop and renders it before config sections
  - `StrategyCard` passes `adminInstructions` to `StrategyConfigCard`
  - `UserChannelCard` renders `userInstructions` when users need to connect

  ## New Telegram Notification Plugin

  Added `@checkstack/notification-telegram-backend` plugin for sending notifications via Telegram:

  - Uses [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework for Telegram Bot API integration
  - Sends messages with MarkdownV2 formatting and inline keyboard buttons for actions
  - Includes comprehensive admin instructions for bot setup via @BotFather
  - Includes user instructions for account linking

  ### Configuration

  Admins need to configure a Telegram Bot Token obtained from @BotFather.

  ### User Linking

  The strategy uses `contactResolution: { type: "custom" }` for Telegram Login Widget integration. Full frontend integration for the Login Widget is pending future work.
