## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 56e7c75: Hide navigation, actions and links that the current user cannot use, so anonymous
  and read-only users no longer see entries that lead to "Access Denied" or to
  actions the server would reject.

  - **Sidebar**: a nav entry can now declare a dynamic `nav.isVisible({ accessRules, isAuthenticated })` predicate (in addition to the static `accessRule`). A group whose every entry is filtered out is no longer rendered. The filtering/grouping logic is extracted to a pure, unit-tested helper.
  - **Infrastructure**: its sidebar entry is shown only when the user can READ at least one contributed tab (queue, cache, …), instead of always (it previously had no static rule because tabs are contributed at runtime).
  - **Notification Settings**: hidden from anonymous users - notifications are per-user, so an anonymous visitor can't have any.
  - **Anomaly Mute / Suppress**: the "Mute" / "Mute all" controls (a per-user preference) are hidden from anonymous visitors; the "Suppress" control is gated on `anomalyAccess.feed.manage`. Both were previously always visible.
  - **Dashboard**: the "Open Catalog" actions (which open the manage-only Catalog config page) are hidden from users without `catalogAccess.system.manage`, and the "View catalog" link is gated on `catalogAccess.system.read`.
  - **Dashboard status signals**: the per-system status rows contributed by plugins (`SystemSignalsSlot`) now render as a LINK only when the user can open the target, and as plain text otherwise. `SystemSignal` gains an optional `accessRule`; the healthcheck, anomaly, and dependency fillers set it for their gated targets (check-history / assignments / dependency-map). Signals pointing at ungated pages (incident / maintenance / SLO detail) stay links.
  - **Plugin Manager**: the "Install plugin" button (which opens the install-gated page) is hidden from users with only `plugin` view access.
  - **Satellites**: the page is entirely manage-gated, but its route/sidebar entry was gated on `read`, so read-only users saw the nav item and hit "Access Denied" on click. The route and nav entry now require `satellite.manage`.

  The `@checkstack/ai-backend` bump is only the regenerated bundled docs index
  (the frontend routing guide gained the `nav.isVisible` section); no code change.

  **BREAKING (`@checkstack/frontend-api`):** the `AccessApi` interface gains a
  required `useIsAuthenticated()` method. Custom `AccessApi` implementations must
  add it (it returns `{ loading, isAuthenticated }`). The built-in auth
  implementation and the no-auth fallback already do. `NavEntry` also gains an
  optional `isVisible` predicate (purely additive).

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- b50916d: Fix "Date cannot be represented in JSON Schema" crashing the AI chat. Zod v4's
  `toJSONSchema()` throws on `z.date()` (and even `z.coerce.date()`) by default,
  and the chat hit this in TWO places:

  - **`@checkstack/backend-api`** `toJsonSchema()` (the OpenAPI generator and AI
    tool-introspection / MCP substrate) called it with no options.
  - **`@checkstack/ai-backend`** the agent loop hands the Vercel AI SDK the raw
    Zod tool input, and the SDK runs its OWN `toJSONSchema()` (throwing) to build
    the model-facing tool schema - so a single date field in any tool input
    crashed every chat turn (the whole tool list is projected before the model is
    called).

  Both now render dates as `{ type: "string", format: "date-time" }` (their wire
  shape) and degrade other unrepresentable types to `{}` instead of throwing.

  For the model boundary, a single `dateSafeModelSchema()` helper hands the SDK a
  ready-made date-safe schema plus a validator that COERCES the ISO strings the
  model emits back into real `Date`s before parsing with the original schema
  (refinements and the downstream RPC client, which expects `Date`s, keep
  working). A single `toModelSchema()` entry point applies this at EVERY point a
  schema is handed to the model - chat tool inputs, the headless agent runner's
  tool inputs (the automation "AI Action"), and `generateObject` structured
  output - gated so non-date schemas are untouched, so individual tool / agent
  definitions never special-case dates. Regression tests cover the converter, the
  AI tool serializer, and the model-schema generation + coercion helper, including
  the full inbound round-trip with the exact ISO shape a live model emits
  (`...T22:00:00Z`, no milliseconds).

  **Timezone correctness.** Because the model produces dates as text, the chat now
  enforces an unambiguous wire contract: a date-time tool argument MUST be RFC 3339
  with an explicit timezone offset. Zone-less (`2026-07-01T22:00:00`) and date-only
  (`2026-07-01`) values are rejected with a model-readable error (the model
  self-repairs), instead of being silently interpreted in the pod's local zone -
  which would resolve the same string to different instants across pods. To resolve
  an operator's bare "22:00", the browser's IANA timezone is sent with every chat
  turn and folded into the system prompt, so each operator's times are interpreted
  in their own zone by default. When no browser zone is available (a headless
  automation AI Action), the reference zone falls back to the host/container
  timezone (`TZ`), not UTC. A format-matrix test covers every common shape a model
  might emit. The chat UI shows the operator which timezone is in use, and the
  `TZ` override is documented for operators.

  **Current time in context.** The model has no clock, so the system prompt now
  includes the current instant (UTC plus the reference-zone wall clock), letting it
  resolve relative dates like "today at 10:00" without asking. Applied to both the
  chat and the headless agent runner, computed per turn/run so it is never stale.

  **Less-strict topic classifier.** The chat's off-topic pre-classifier was
  refusing legitimate requests like "create a maintenance" because maintenances
  (and several other domains) were not listed. The classifier now enumerates the
  full domain set and treats any create/list/update/delete action on a platform
  resource as on-topic by default.

### Patch Changes

- 00b9367: Refresh the bundled docs search index (`ai.searchDocs` / `ai.getDoc`) for the
  updated plugin-authoring documentation: one-off `bunx` examples now pin
  `@latest`, committed `pack` scripts use the installed `checkstack-scripts` bin,
  and a new "Keep the tooling current" section documents Bun's scaffolder cache
  behaviour (latest re-resolved per run within the ~5 min registry-manifest
  window; tarballs content-addressed by version). Cutting this release also
  rebuilds the Docker image, so the bundled in-app docs served at `/checkstack/*`
  pick up the changes.

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: AI chat UX: ordered turns, readable diffs, persistent errors, auto-titles, decision acknowledgments, and a smarter topical guard.

  - Turns render as ordered parts (text / tool-call status / confirm card) in chronological order, with inline tool-error lines and a mid-turn "Thinking..." indicator, instead of one text blob plus a flat tool list. The confirm card and tool-step parts no longer vanish after a turn finishes (hydration seeds once per conversation id via `useInitOnceForKey`, so background refetches are no-ops).
  - Errors persist: in-stream provider errors are lifted into the chat hook's durable error state and shown in a dismissible banner with selectable text and a Copy button (single-line digest, full text on hover); it clears on send / open / new chat. The backend installs an `onError` handler that logs the provider's full HTTP response and returns a readable message, and normalizes the model message history (drop empty rows, merge consecutive same-role rows, strip a leading non-user row) so a single provider hiccup can no longer brick a conversation.
  - Confirm/applied card diffs render as a GitHub-style split diff (line-number gutters, per-line tint, word-level highlighting, an "Expand" pop-out). `computeFieldDiff` recurses into arrays element-wise so a single changed leaf is pinpointed instead of dumping whole serialized arrays.
  - Conversations auto-title after the first user message (cheap `generateText` reusing the turn's model, fire-and-forget, heuristic fallback). "New chat" opens immediately and reuses an empty untitled draft instead of spawning duplicates; "Delete" is a soft archive (`archived_at` on `ai_conversations`, data retained). A clean model picker always renders a `Select` of `[defaultModel, ...availableModels]` de-duplicated.
  - The assistant acknowledges a confirm-card decision (a new `decision` mode -> `streamDecision`) instead of going silent after an apply/decline; the decision note is derived server-side from the stored proposal and is ephemeral.
  - A cheap topical pre-classifier short-circuits off-topic turns with a canned refusal (fail-open, spend recorded). It marks meta/capability/greeting/how-to questions as ON_TOPIC; only clearly unrelated requests (coding help, creative writing, trivia) are refused.
  - The chat agent no longer emits duplicate proposals for one request: propose/auto-apply results carry an explicit model-facing "stop and wait" note, and a per-turn `<tool>:<argsHash>` dedupe short-circuits repeated identical mutating calls.
  - Assistant messages render through the shared `<MarkdownBlock>`: it now parses a SAFE subset of raw HTML (`rehype-raw` + `rehype-sanitize`) so native `<details>`/`<summary>` widgets render, and enables `remark-gfm` so GFM tables, strikethrough, and autolinks render (the assistant often summarizes drafts as tables).

  State and scale: the archive marker, titles, and permission mode all live in the shared `ai_conversations` table, read identically on every pod; the classifier holds no state and its spend is recorded in the shared `ai_spend` ledger. No new pod-local state.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Add the AI platform: a transport-agnostic tool spine, an OAuth Authorization Server + read-only MCP server, a propose/apply flow with audit log, a streaming in-app chat agent, per-conversation permission modes, per-integration spend caps, and user-scoped tool authorization.

  Two new packages, `@checkstack/ai-common` (the `AiTool` contract, `read`/`mutate`/`destructive` effect classification, the `ai.*` access rules, the OpenAI-compatible connection shape, and the wire contracts) and `@checkstack/ai-backend` (the tool registry, extension points, principal-to-tool resolver, shared zod-to-JSON-Schema serializer, and all transports). The OpenAI-compatible integration provider registers through the existing integration provider extension point, so its API key is stored in the Secrets Vault and configured in the generic Connections UI.

  What ships:

  - Tool spine and extension points: `aiToolExtensionPoint.registerTool` (hand-authored composite tools) and `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint.expose` (opt-in projections of existing oRPC procedures). Authorization mirrors `autoAuthMiddleware` exactly - a tool is surfaced only when every `requiredAccessRules` entry is satisfied, so a scope-narrowed principal can only ever see fewer tools.
  - OAuth + MCP: Checkstack can act as its own OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server (authorization code + PKCE, consent screen, Dynamic Client Registration) and expose a read-only MCP server over Streamable HTTP at `/api/ai/mcp`. Off by default, enabled by the admin `ai.mcp-oauth` setting. A Bearer OAuth-token branch is added to the auth strategy; token scopes are intersected live with the bound user's access rules on every call. A shared-Postgres rate limiter throttles the DCR endpoint per client IP. `getMcpOAuthSettings` / `setMcpOAuthSettings` contracts added to `@checkstack/auth-common`. A minimal OAuth consent page (`/auth/oauth-consent`) renders the requesting client and scopes.
  - Propose/apply + audit: a transport-agnostic two-step service - `propose` re-checks authz, runs the tool's `dryRun` without mutating, and returns a single-use proposal token (the `proposed` audit row IS the token store, 10-minute TTL, atomic single-use); `apply` re-parses the server-stored payload, re-checks authz, and atomically commits. The `ai_tool_calls` audit table records every call across both transports with a SHA-256 args hash (never raw arguments) and stamps who proposed and who applied. An `ai.toolCalled` event carries metadata only.
  - In-app chat: a server-side, provider-agnostic Vercel AI SDK agent loop (OpenAI, Azure, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, ...). The model provider is built on the backend from the integration credentials, so the API key never leaves the backend. The loop offers only resolver-allowed tools, auto-runs read tools (re-entering the live router as the logged-in user) and routes mutating / destructive tools through propose/apply. Durable conversation persistence (`ai_conversations`, `ai_messages`, owner-scoped RPCs) plus a streaming chat UI with a confirm-card component and per-integration model picker.
  - Per-conversation permission mode (Claude-Code-style approve/auto), a durable `permission_mode` column on `ai_conversations` (default `approve`). `read` always auto-runs in both modes; `mutate` inherits the mode (auto-applies server-side in `auto`, confirm-carded in `approve`); `destructive` ALWAYS requires the human `applyTool` in both modes. Security invariant (structural + tested): the mode is consulted only on the `mutate` branch, so no `(effect, mode)` pair routes a destructive tool to auto-apply.
  - Per-integration LLM spend cap (optional `spendCap` = `tokenBudget` + `windowMinutes`, default OFF). Spend is tracked in a shared-Postgres `ai_spend` ledger; enforcement is a rolling-window SUM run before each turn (HTTP 429 over budget). Per-principal tool rate-limit budgets are a rolling COUNT over `ai_tool_calls`, enforced on both transports. An absent / empty / incomplete `spendCap` is treated as "no cap" rather than rejected.
  - Full tool-call replay: `ai_messages.model_messages` (jsonb) persists the canonical AI-SDK `ResponseMessage[]` per turn and replays them verbatim on the next turn; legacy rows fall back to text-only replay.
  - Enforced no-secret-leak scrubbing: `appendMessage` runs `scrubContent` on every write, redacting credential-shaped keys and high-confidence credential values; a canary regression test asserts injected secrets are stripped. A hardening test suite asserts no secret appears in any AI-surface DTO and that handler-side authz holds when the model misbehaves.
  - Provider correctness: the chat provider uses `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`'s `chatModel` (plain `/chat/completions`), so OpenAI-compatible gateways (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, vLLM) no longer reject turns with `invalid_prompt`; `@ai-sdk/openai` is removed.

  BREAKING CHANGES:

  - The `AiTool` contract (`@checkstack/ai-common`) gained a `TRpc` type parameter, and both `dryRun` and `execute` now receive a USER-SCOPED `rpcClient` arg bound to the originating user. Every plugin procedure a tool calls re-enters the live router AS THAT USER, so handler-side authorization (access rules AND per-resource/team scope) is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC call - closing a prior privilege-escalation where tools captured a trusted service client at construction. A hand-authored tool MUST resolve its plugin client from this per-call arg and MUST NOT capture a trusted service client at factory scope. Tool factories that previously took `{ rpcClient }` should drop that parameter.
  - `AiToolProjectionExtensionPoint.expose` no longer takes a second `pluginMetadata` argument; the owning metadata lives on `input.sourcePluginMetadata`. Callers must drop the second argument.

  State and scale: conversations, messages, the audit log, proposal tokens, the rate-limit counter, and the spend ledger all live in shared Postgres, so every pod answers identically and the agent loop is resumable on any pod. The only pod-local state is the live MCP connection registry (bookkeeping, never a source of truth). Cross-pod conversation readback, the spend cap, and the tool budget are verified by env-gated two-pod integration tests.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Plugin-owned AI tools: every domain plugin contributes its own AI tools (chat assistant + automation AI action), and `ai-backend` is platform-only.

  Every plugin-specific AI tool is owned by the plugin whose domain it acts on, registered via that plugin's own `aiToolExtensionPoint` / `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint` from its init - the same path an external plugin author uses. `ai-backend` no longer imports or depends on any capability plugin's `*-common`; the dependency direction is strictly plugin -> ai-platform. Pure helpers (`computeFieldDiff`, capability-summary, `ScriptContextKind`) live in `@checkstack/ai-common`.

  Tools shipped:

  - Health checks and automations: full CRUD - `healthcheck.propose` / `automation.propose` and `*.update` (`mutate`, deep-validated) and `*.delete` (`destructive`, always confirm-gated). `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run calls the new deep `validateConfiguration` so propose-time validation matches apply-time. Assertions are validated against the collector's result schema and the canonical operator vocabulary. Capability-catalog tools (`ai.listCapabilities`, `ai.getCapabilitySchema`), script context tools (`ai.getScriptContext`, `ai.testScript`), and notify-subscriber tools (`healthcheck.notifySystemSubscribers` / `...GroupSubscribers`).
  - Catalog: `catalog.createSystem` / `updateSystem` / `createGroup` / `updateGroup` (`mutate`), `catalog.deleteSystem` / `deleteGroup` (`destructive`), membership tools (`mutate`), plus `catalog.listSystems` / `listGroups` read projections.
  - Incident: `incident.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `resolve` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `incident.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `incident.get` / `incident.list` read projections.
  - Maintenance: `maintenance.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `close` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `maintenance.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `maintenance.list` / `get` read projections.
  - Read projections for SLO (`slo.listObjectives`), dependency (`dependency.list`), incident (`incident.list`), healthcheck (`healthcheck.status`), and anomaly (`anomaly.explain`), each gated by the source procedure's own access rule and routed as the principal.
  - Documentation grounding: `ai.searchDocs` / `ai.getDoc` over a build-time bundled docs index (BM25-ish ranking), so the assistant grounds how-to answers in Checkstack's own docs offline.
  - URL introspection: `ai.probeUrl`, an SSRF-guarded read tool the assistant uses to inspect a real endpoint before drafting a health check. Update tools compute a before -> after field diff rendered on the confirm card (approve mode) or an "Applied" card (auto mode), so a change is never silent.

  `ai_analyze` automation action (automation-backend, with an editor connection picker + audited tool calls): runs a bounded AI agent on the run context as the automation's `runAs` service account, so it can never exceed that identity's permissions; destructive tools are never offered; mutating tools auto-apply through the service account's client. Produces an `automation.analysis` artifact downstream actions can branch on. The agent loop is exposed as a headless `aiAgentRunnerRef` service so automation-backend can drive it without depending on ai-backend.

  `notification.notifyForSubscription` is now callable by user / application principals holding `notification.send` (previously service-only). Every tool routes through the user-scoped client, so handler-side authorization is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC action; the resolver gate plus the propose/apply re-check at propose AND apply are the additional authority. A systemic authz regression test asserts every registered tool falls into exactly one safe authorization category.

  A new `ai_transport` enum value `automation` records the AI action's tool calls in the `ai_tool_calls` audit log. No new durable state beyond that; each tool is a thin, deterministic wrapper over an existing RPC, so every pod behaves identically.

  This is a beta minor.

- 9dcc848: Add a deep `validateConfiguration` RPC to the health-check plugin so propose-time validation matches apply-time validation.

  - `validateConfiguration` (`@checkstack/healthcheck-common`): a new mutation procedure gated by `healthcheck.healthcheck.manage`, taking a proposed configuration (reusing the create skeleton) and returning `{ valid, errors: [{ path, message }] }`, mirroring automation's `validateDefinition`. It persists nothing.
  - Shared deep validation (`@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`): `collectConfigurationIssues` resolves strategy + collectors by fully-qualified id then migrate-then-validate-strict each config via `parseStrictAssumingV1`. The GitOps reconcile path is refactored to call the same `validateVersionedConfigStrict`, so create / gitops-apply / the new RPC share one implementation.
  - `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run (`@checkstack/ai-backend`) now calls `validateConfiguration` as its validation authority, so a wrong config type or a typo'd key surfaces at propose time, bringing it to the same deep-validate level `automation.propose` already has.

  State and scale: no durable state; `validateConfiguration` is a pure read against the in-process registries plus zod validation, identical on every pod.

  This is a beta minor.
