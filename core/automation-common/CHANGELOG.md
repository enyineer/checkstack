### Minor Changes

- e2d6f25: feat(automation): connection picker for integration actions + restore Integrations menu

  Connection-backed automation actions (Jira, Teams, Webex) now render a
  working connection picker plus cascading provider dropdowns in the
  visual editor, and the Integrations entry is back in the user menu.

  **Contract.** `ActionDefinition` gained an optional
  `connectionProviderId` (and it is surfaced on `ActionInfoSchema` and
  mapped in the `listActions` router). It carries the integration
  provider's fully-qualified id, derived from the provider plugin's own
  `pluginMetadata.pluginId` (never a hardcoded string), so the editor
  knows which provider backs an action's dropdowns and it matches the
  `qualifiedId` the integration provider registry assigns.

  **Providers.** Jira, Teams and Webex each export
  `*_PROVIDER_LOCAL_ID` / `*_PROVIDER_QUALIFIED_ID`, register their
  provider with the local id, and add a `CONNECTION_OPTIONS`
  (`"connectionOptions"`) resolver name. Their `post_message` /
  issue actions set `connectionProviderId` and expose `connectionId`
  as an `x-options-resolver` dropdown instead of a hidden field.

  **Frontend bridge.** A new `useConnectionOptionResolvers` hook
  (`@checkstack/automation-frontend`, which now depends on
  `@checkstack/integration-common`) turns an action's
  `x-options-resolver` schema fields into live data: the
  `connectionOptions` resolver lists the provider's connections via
  `listConnections`, and every other resolver name is forwarded to
  `getConnectionOptions` for the selected `connectionId`, passing the
  live form values as `context` for dependent fields. `ProviderActionBody`
  now passes this map to `DynamicForm` (it was previously missing
  entirely, so connection-backed actions had no working dropdowns).

  **frontend-api.** `usePluginClient` procedures now also expose a typed
  imperative `.call(input)` alongside `.useQuery` / `.useMutation`, for
  async callbacks that cannot host a hook (such as a `DynamicForm`
  options resolver). Additive, non-breaking.

  **Integrations menu.** Re-added `IntegrationMenuItem` and a new
  `IntegrationsLandingPage`, wired into `integration-frontend` as a list
  route and a `UserMenuItemsSlot` entry under the "Configuration" group.

  **Action card polish.** The action editor's secondary metadata (id,
  description, failure behaviour) is now grouped into one quiet settings
  panel with consistent small uppercase "eyebrow" labels, so the action's
  own configuration stays the focal point. The raw failure checkbox was
  replaced with the standard `Checkbox` control, and the provider action
  picker / configuration sections gained consistent section headers and a
  divider. The per-step "type" dropdown was removed: an action's kind is
  fixed at creation, so changing it now means adding a new step and
  deleting the old one (avoids the surprising full-config reset that
  switching kinds used to trigger).

  **Add-step picker.** Adding a step now opens a Home-Assistant-style
  dialog where the operator decides the step type up front: an "Actions"
  tab lists the registered provider actions grouped by category
  (searchable; picking one presets the step's `action`), and a "Blocks"
  tab lists the structural building blocks (choose / parallel / repeat /
  etc.). Because the concrete action is chosen here, the in-card action
  switcher was removed - a step's action is fixed once created. Composite
  blocks now start with an empty child list (filled via the nested
  add-step picker) instead of seeding an unconfigurable empty action.

- e1a2077: feat(automation): reference artifacts by explicit action id (`artifacts.<id>.<name>`)

  Multiple actions of the same type (e.g. two "create Jira issue" steps) used
  to collide: both produced the artifact type `integration-jira.issue`, so a
  template could only ever reach "the most recent one of that type". Artifacts
  are now addressed by the producing action's instance `id` instead.

  - Templates reference a produced artifact solely as
    `{{ artifacts.<actionId>.<localArtifactName>.<field> }}`, e.g.
    `{{ artifacts.open_jira.issue.issueKey }}`. The local artifact name is the
    producing action's `produces` id with the owning plugin prefix stripped
    (`integration-jira.issue` -> `issue`).
  - `@checkstack/automation-backend`: the dispatch engine nests each produced
    artifact under `artifacts[actionId][localName]` in the template scope and
    records the `actionId` on the artifact row. `validate-definition` now
    enforces that action ids are unique within an automation and that every
    artifact-producing action carries an id.
  - `@checkstack/automation-common`: action `id` is constrained to an
    identifier (`/^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$/`) so it is always usable as a
    plain template segment. The variable-scope resolver surfaces
    `artifacts.<id>.<name>` (with full field completion) in the editor.
  - `@checkstack/automation-frontend`: the action editor now has editable `Id`
    and `Description` inputs (previously settable only via the YAML view), and
    new steps get an auto-assigned, unique, log-friendly default id that the
    operator can rename. Action ids are recorded on every run step, so run
    logs are parseable by id regardless of kind.

  **BREAKING (beta):** the previous flat, type-keyed scope form
  `{{ artifacts["integration-jira.issue"] }}` is removed. Reference artifacts
  by the producing action's id instead. Action ids may no longer contain
  hyphens or dots (identifier characters only). Artifacts are per-run and
  ephemeral, so no stored-data migration is needed.

- 41c77f4: feat(automation): native per-editor context for script actions (typed `context` for TS, `$ENV` for shell)

  Script action editors had a confusing dual system: the TypeScript editor
  type-checked `{{ }}` template text as code (so `{{ artifact.x }}` errored
  with "Cannot find name"), and the runtime never actually populated the
  `context` object. This standardises on a single, native context-access
  mechanism per editor kind.

  **Run scope reaches actions.** `ActionExecutionContext` gains a `scope`
  (`{ trigger, artifacts, vars, repeat? }`), populated by the dispatch
  engine from the same scope it already uses for `{{ }}` rendering. Actions
  that need broad context (the script actions) read from it instead of
  having to declare every artifact type in `consumes`. Additive and
  optional, so existing actions are unaffected.

  **TypeScript / JavaScript → typed `context`.** `run_script` now builds
  `context` from the run scope, so `context.trigger.payload`,
  `context.artifacts`, `context.var`, `context.repeat`, and
  `context.automation` are populated at run time (previously
  `context.trigger` was always empty). The editor types match via
  `generateAutomationContextTypes`.

  **Shell → `$CHECKSTACK_*` env vars.** `run_shell` flattens the run scope
  into environment variables (e.g. `$CHECKSTACK_TRIGGER_PAYLOAD_TITLE`,
  `$CHECKSTACK_ARTIFACT_INTEGRATION_JIRA_ISSUE_ISSUEKEY`). Arrays become a
  single newline-separated var (iterate with `while IFS= read -r x; do …;
done <<< "$VAR"`). Every value is a plain string — no JSON blob, since
  the container has no `jq` to parse one. A shared `toShellEnvKey`
  helper (in `@checkstack/automation-common`) derives the names so the
  shell editor's `$` autocomplete lists exactly what the runtime injects.

  **One syntax per field kind (editor + runtime).** `MultiTypeEditorField`
  no longer offers `{{ }}` autocomplete in `typescript` / `javascript` /
  `shell` editors, and the dispatch engine no longer template-renders
  native-code config fields (those whose `x-editor-types` is a code type) —
  so `{{ }}` can't be used in a script by accident. Text / markup editors
  (`raw`, `json`, `yaml`, `xml`, `markdown`, `formdata`) and plain string
  fields keep `{{ }}` as before. Because both the automation and
  health-check editors share `MultiTypeEditorField`, they behave
  identically.

  **Script-editor IntelliSense polish.** The code editors got a few
  ergonomic fixes so the typed context is actually usable: the suggestion
  **details panel auto-opens** (so long completion names are legible
  on-focus, not hidden behind the chevron); word-based keyword noise is
  disabled in favour of language-service + provider completions; and a
  TS/JS completion provider makes `context.artifacts.` list the in-scope
  artifact ids and **auto-convert the dot to bracket notation** —
  `context.artifacts["integration-jira.issue"]` — since those ids aren't
  valid identifiers. (Driven by a new opt-in `dottedKeyCompletions` prop on
  the editor / `DynamicForm`.)

  **BREAKING (beta):** `{{ }}` interpolation inside a script action's
  `script` field (shell or TypeScript) is no longer expanded at run time —
  read run data via the typed `context` object (TS) or `$CHECKSTACK_*` env
  vars (shell) instead. Non-script config fields are unchanged.

  Also fixes: switching a provider action in the visual editor now resets
  its config, so the validator no longer reports the previous action's keys
  as unrecognised.

- 41c77f4: feat(automation): Phase 11 — editor primitives + context type generation

  Lays the UI + type-generation groundwork for Phase 12's visual automation
  editor. Every primitive reuses the existing Monaco wrapper / template
  engine / `jsonSchemaToTypeScript` helper rather than building parallel
  infrastructure.

  **`@checkstack/automation-common` — `resolveVariableScope`**

  Pure walker that returns the in-scope `{{ … }}` paths at a given action
  position. Conservative scoping rules: linear-upstream variables /
  artifacts only (no leaking across `choose` / `parallel` / `repeat`
  branches), `repeat.index` / `repeat.item` exposed only inside a `repeat`,
  and trigger.payload modelled as a **discriminated union over
  `trigger.event`** — every payload field surfaces; ones that come from a
  subset of subscribed triggers carry a `conditionalOnTriggers` annotation
  so the picker can render an "Only when …" hint. Earlier draft used
  schema-intersection; switched to discriminated unions per review
  feedback so Monaco can narrow correctly inside event-gated branches.

  **Condition-aware narrowing.** When the path descends through a
  `choose-when`, the resolver parses the branch's `when:` expression and
  statically pins `trigger.event` to the set the condition allows —
  patterns covered are `trigger.event == "X"` (either operand order),
  `trigger.event != "X"`, `||`/`&&` of those, and `{ and: [...] }` /
  `{ or: [...] }` combinators. So an action inside
  `when: 'trigger.event == "incident.created"'` sees only the
  `incident.created` variant in scope, the `conditionalOnTriggers`
  annotation disappears, and other-trigger fields drop out entirely.
  Nested choose branches compound (intersection). Anything outside the
  covered patterns falls back to the full union — better to show every
  field than guess wrong.

  **`@checkstack/template-engine`**

  The expression AST (`Expr`, `BinaryExpr`, `MemberExpr`, etc.) is now a
  public export — the resolver's condition-narrowing walker needs to
  inspect parsed condition trees. `ParsedCondition.root` is tightened
  from `unknown` to `Expr` so consumers don't need to cast.

  **`@checkstack/automation-frontend` — `generateAutomationContextTypes`**

  Consumes `resolveVariableScope`'s output + the trigger / artifact
  registries and emits the `declare const context: { … }` TS declaration
  that `integration-script.run_script`'s Monaco editor injects via
  `addExtraLib`. The emitted shape:

  ```ts
  type AutomationTrigger =
    | { event: "incident.created"; payload: { … } }
    | { event: "incident.resolved"; payload: { … } };

  declare const context: {
    trigger: AutomationTrigger;
    artifacts: { "jira.issue"?: { key: string; … }; … };
    var: { foo?: string; … };
    repeat: { index: number; item: unknown };  // only when inside a repeat
  };
  ```

  `jsonSchemaToTypeScript` from `@checkstack/ui` is reused via a deep
  import (rather than the barrel) so the bun test runner doesn't try to
  load Monaco's Vite-only `?worker` modules during unit tests.

  **`@checkstack/ui` — new editor primitives**

  - `TemplateValueInput` — single-line `{{ }}` autocomplete input.
    Extracted from `DynamicForm/KeyValueEditor`'s previously-private
    `TemplateInput` so other editor surfaces can share it without
    rebuilding the picker UX. `KeyValueEditor` is now a one-line
    delegation; `detectTemplateContext` is also exported.
  - `VariablePicker` — hierarchical popover for the explicit "fx" /
    "Insert variable" workflow. Renders a filterable tree of
    `VariableNode`s with type chips and `Only when …` hints sourced from
    the resolver's `conditionalOnTriggers`. Defaults to a small "fx" pill
    trigger; callers can pass a custom one.
  - `TemplateInput` — high-level mode switcher: `text` mode delegates to
    `TemplateValueInput`, all other modes (`code` / `bash` / `json` /
    `yaml`) delegate to `CodeEditor` with the matching language so the
    action editor can swap widgets purely from the action's
    `x-editor-types` annotation without touching the consuming code.
  - `TemplateInputToggle` — the small "fx" pill that flips a typed input
    (number / select / date / …) into template mode and back. Auto-infers
    template mode when the saved value already starts with `{{`, so
    round-tripping a previously-templated automation works out of the
    box. Render-prop API for the typed editor so consumers keep control
    over their own input shape.
  - `ActionCard` — collapsible card that hosts a single action in the
    visual editor. Decoupled from `DynamicForm` so container blocks
    (`ChooseBlock` / `ParallelBlock` / `RepeatBlock` in Phase 12) can use
    it as a structural shell over their own children. Toggle / delete /
    drag handle are conditionally rendered on their callback's presence.

  Storybook stories shipped for each of the new primitives.

  **`@checkstack/integration-script-backend`**

  `ScriptContext` docstring and the `scriptRunConfigSchema.script` field
  description now point at `generateAutomationContextTypes` so the Phase
  12 editor wiring is unambiguous — the runtime payload type stays
  `Record<string, unknown>` (the runner can't know the trigger schema),
  but the **editor** narrows it per-automation from the subscribed
  triggers' payload schemas.

- 41c77f4: feat(automation): backend RPC router with the full 15-endpoint contract

  Wires up `core/automation-backend/src/router.ts` covering automation CRUD,
  definition validation, manual runs, run history, registry introspection,
  and a template playground. The contract is refactored to use the
  project's `proc()` pattern so `autoAuthMiddleware` enforces `read` /
  `manage` access automatically, and `AutomationApi` is exported via
  `createClientDefinition` for the frontend client.

- 41c77f4: feat(automation): one-time migration of webhook subscriptions + remove legacy integration backend

  **BREAKING CHANGES** (platform is in BETA — no major bump):

  - `IntegrationProvider` no longer carries `config` (subscription
    config) or `deliver`. The interface now models a connection provider
    only: connection schema + `getConnectionOptions` + `testConnection`.
  - The legacy subscription / delivery-log / event endpoints
    (`listSubscriptions`, `createSubscription`, `getDeliveryLogs`,
    `listEventTypes`, …) are removed from `integrationContract`.
  - `delivery-coordinator`, `hook-subscriber`, `event-registry`, and the
    `integrationEventExtensionPoint` are deleted. Plugins that
    previously called `integrationEvents.registerEvent(...)` now
    register their hooks as automation triggers via
    `automationTriggerExtensionPoint.registerTrigger(...)`.
  - Frontend pages `IntegrationsPage` and `DeliveryLogsPage` are gone;
    the integration plugin's only remaining UI is connection
    management. Subscription management lives under `/automation/...`.
  - `webhook_subscriptions` and `delivery_logs` tables stay in the
    database for one release as a safety net (no code reads or writes
    them), and will be dropped in a follow-up migration.

  **New**:

  - `jira.create_issue`, `teams.post_message`, `webex.post_message`,
    `webhook.send`, `integration-script.run_shell`, and
    `integration-script.run_script` actions registered against the
    Automation Platform with matching `*.message`, `*.delivery`,
    `shell.result`, and `script.result` artifact types. The script
    plugin exposes **two** actions — `run_shell` runs bash via the
    shared `ShellScriptRunner` (Monaco `shell` editor), `run_script`
    runs an ESM module in a Bun subprocess via `EsmScriptRunner`
    (Monaco `typescript` editor + `defineIntegration` helper) — to
    preserve the legacy provider split. `jira.create_issue` keeps the
    dynamic field-mapping dropdown (driven by
    `JIRA_RESOLVERS.FIELD_OPTIONS`).
  - One-time data migration runs on boot in
    `automation-backend.afterPluginsReady`. It reads
    `webhook_subscriptions` via a new service RPC
    `IntegrationApi.listLegacySubscriptions`, translates each row into
    a single-trigger / single-action automation (marked with
    `managed_by = "migrated-subscription:<id>"`), and is idempotent
    across restarts.
  - Failed translations are recorded in a new
    `automation_migration_failures` table and surfaced via
    `AutomationApi.listMigrationFailures` /
    `acknowledgeMigrationFailure` so admins can review and re-create
    failed entries by hand.

- 4832e33: fix(automation): insert runtime-parseable `templateRef` from editor autocomplete + variable picker, with array indexing

  The automation editor's `{{ }}` autocomplete and the `fx` variable picker
  previously inserted the canonical dotted path (e.g.
  `artifact.integration-jira.issue.issueKey`), which the template engine
  cannot parse when an artifact id contains dots or hyphens, and which used
  the singular `artifact`/`var` namespaces the runtime template context does
  not expose. They now insert the runtime-parseable `templateRef` form -
  plural top-level namespace (`artifacts`/`variables`) plus bracket notation
  for non-identifier segments, e.g. `artifacts["integration-jira.issue"].issueKey`.

  - `@checkstack/automation-common`: `VariableEntry` gains `templateRef`
    (runtime-parseable insertion form) and `referenceable`, alongside the
    unchanged canonical `path`. New exported helpers `isTemplateIdentifier`,
    `appendTemplateSegment`, and `appendArrayIndex` build the form. Scope
    derivation now descends into `array` schemas, offering both the whole
    array and a representative element subtree (`tags[0]`, `comments[0].author`,
    nested `matrix[0][0]`).
  - `CompletionField` / `TemplateProperty` / `VariableNode` carry a
    `templateRef` alongside the canonical `path`.
  - The staged completion provider's field label, filter/match, insert text,
    and value-stage field lookup all operate in `templateRef` space. The
    expression tokenizer now emits bracket tokens and reconstructs the full
    `foo["bar"].baz` / `foo["bar"].list[0]` access chain (normalising single
    quotes to the stored double-quoted form, and supporting bare numeric array
    indices) so value-stage enum suggestions resolve for bracket-notation and
    indexed fields.
  - `VariablePicker` and the `DynamicForm` template inserters write the
    `templateRef` (falling back to `path` when absent).
  - Shell-env (`$CHECKSTACK_*`) name derivation deliberately keeps using the
    canonical dotted `path`, so the suggested env names stay byte-identical
    to the backend's path-based injection. Script-context type generation is
    unchanged.
  - `@checkstack/integration-script-backend`: shell-script actions now also
    expose array elements as indexed `$CHECKSTACK_*_<i>` env vars (and
    `$CHECKSTACK_*_<i>_<field>` for object elements), alongside the existing
    whole-array newline-joined var, so the runtime injects exactly the
    array-element names the editor now suggests.

- 6d52276: feat(automation): expose `trigger.actor` so automations can filter on who/what caused an event

  Every platform event now carries an **actor** - the user, application (API
  client), service (backend-to-backend), or `system` (background /
  unauthenticated) that caused it - and the automation engine surfaces it to
  automations as `trigger.actor`. This lets a trigger filter gate on the
  origin of the event it reacts to:

  ```text
  {{ trigger.actor.type == "system" }}      # auto-created by the platform
  {{ trigger.actor.type == "user" }}         # a human
  {{ trigger.actor.id == "app-deploybot" }}  # a specific application
  ```

  `trigger.actor` is available on **every** trigger - it is injected by the
  platform, not declared per trigger - and editor autocomplete + Run Script
  context types include `trigger.actor.{type,id,name}`.

  How it works:

  - **`@checkstack/common`** adds the canonical `Actor` type / `ActorSchema`
    and `SYSTEM_ACTOR`.
  - **`@checkstack/backend-api`** adds `resolveActor(user)` and a
    `HookEventMeta` envelope. The hook listener / `onHook` signature gains an
    optional second `meta` argument (additive, backward compatible).
  - **`@checkstack/backend`** wraps emitted hooks in an envelope so the actor
    travels with the payload through the distributed queue, unwrapping it
    before delivery. The RPC emit path captures the authenticated caller;
    background emits default to the system actor. Raw/legacy queue data is
    treated as a system-actor payload, so delivery stays backward compatible.
  - **`@checkstack/automation-backend`** threads the actor into the dispatch
    scope (`trigger.actor`), available to trigger filters, top-level
    conditions, and all run templates, and persisted in the run's scope
    snapshot. Manual runs are attributed to the invoking user.
  - **`@checkstack/automation-common`** / **`@checkstack/automation-frontend`**
    expose `trigger.actor` in the editor variable scope and the generated
    Run Script `context.trigger.actor` types.

  No database migration and no per-trigger schema changes: the actor rides as
  event-envelope metadata and in the run scope snapshot.

- 6d52276: feat(automation): expose `trigger.id` and reconcile the trigger scope so multiple triggers are distinguishable

  Automations with more than one trigger could not tell which trigger fired:
  the trigger id wasn't queryable, and scripts only received `trigger.event`
  (so two triggers on the same event were indistinguishable). This exposes a
  consistent trigger contract everywhere - `trigger.id`, `trigger.event`,
  `trigger.actor`, `trigger.payload` - in templates, shell, and TypeScript
  scripts.

  - **`trigger.id` is now available** in templates (`{{ trigger.id }}`) and in
    the script context (`context.trigger.id`). It is typed as the **literal
    union** of the automation's trigger ids, so it discriminates triggers -
    including two subscribed to the same `event`.
  - **Auto-generated trigger ids.** The editor now assigns a unique, log-
    friendly id to every trigger (derived from its event, e.g.
    `incident_created`, deduped as `incident_created_2`), mirroring action ids:
    seeded on the starter automation, assigned on add, and re-filled on blur.
  - **Scripts now receive `trigger.id` and `trigger.actor`.** The
    `ActionRunScope` projection previously dropped both (it only forwarded
    `event` + `payload`), so `context.trigger.actor` was typed but never
    populated - that gap is fixed.
  - **Scope key reconciled.** The internal dispatch scope now exposes
    `trigger.event` as the canonical key (matching the editor and script
    contract) instead of leaking `trigger.eventId`; `trigger.eventId` is kept
    as a back-compat alias, so `{{ trigger.event }}` now resolves in template
    fields where it previously returned `undefined`.

  No database migration: the actor and id ride in the run scope snapshot. A
  shared `deriveTriggerId` is exported from `@checkstack/automation-common` so
  the editor, generated script types, and the runtime all agree on derived ids.
