# @checkstack/secrets-frontend

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 270ef29: Add the Secrets platform (Phase 1): a central, plugin-agnostic secret manager with a pluggable backend extension point, a cross-plugin resolver service, and a universal Jenkins-style masking layer.

  - New packages: `secrets-common` (schemas, contract, `secrets.read`/`secrets.manage`, masking utils), `secrets-backend` (`SecretBackend` extension point, `secretResolverRef`/`secretAdminRef` services, run-scoped masking context, RPC router), `secrets-backend-local` (default AES-256-GCM backend, owns the `secrets` table promoted from gitops), `secrets-frontend` (admin Settings page).
  - Resolution machinery (`resolveSecretsBySchema`, `SecretStore`, `${{ secrets.NAME }}` / `x-secret`) is promoted out of `gitops-backend` into `secrets-backend`. GitOps now resolves and manages secrets through the platform's service refs (single source of truth); its secret table is migrated without loss.
  - Universal masking seam wired at the central script-output boundaries: automation `run_script` / `run_shell` artifacts and the in-UI test panel redact run-scoped secret values from `result`/`stdout`/`stderr`/`error` before persist/return. Phase 1 resolves no run-scoped secrets yet, so masking is a no-op until Phase 2; the seam guarantees the boundary exists.
  - No endpoint returns a secret value to a browser: DTOs expose only name/metadata/`hasValue`.

  BREAKING CHANGES: `gitops-backend` now depends on `secrets-backend` and resolves/manages secrets through it. The `secrets` table is owned by `secrets-backend-local`; the gitops `secrets` table is retained as a migration source but is no longer the source of truth.

- 270ef29: Secrets platform Phase 2: secret -> env-var mapping with central resolve, inject, and mask.

  - Script consumers declare a least-privilege `secretEnv` allowlist
    (`{ ENV_NAME: "${{ secrets.NAME }}" }`). The automation `run_script` /
    `run_shell` actions resolve ONLY the declared secrets via
    `secretResolverRef.resolveForRun`, inject them into the runner env for
    that run (memory-only; the ESM runner gained a per-run `env` option), and
    mask their values out of stdout/stderr/result/error via the run-scoped
    masking context. A missing required secret fails the run clearly. No
    ambient secret access.
  - Test panel: `testScript` / `testCollectorScript` inject named
    `__SECRET_<NAME>__` placeholders by default, or user-supplied per-secret
    overrides; real production values are never resolved in the test path,
    and overrides are masked out of the result.
  - Healthcheck collectors carry the `secretEnv` field for authoring +
    the test panel; runtime injection on satellites lands in Phase 3.
  - Editor UX: a new `@checkstack/ui` `SecretEnvEditor` renders `x-secret-env`
    record fields with `${{ secrets.* }}` name autocomplete (from
    `listSecretNames`), wired into the automation action editor and the
    healthcheck collector editor. New `withConfigMeta` helper +
    `x-secret-env` config-meta key in `@checkstack/backend-api`.

- 270ef29: Secrets platform Phase 4: HashiCorp Vault backend + backend selection.

  - New `@checkstack/secrets-backend-vault`: a read-through `SecretBackend`
    against Vault. Token, AppRole, and OIDC/JWT auth (session cached to the
    lease TTL, capped); KV v2 reads mapped via the backend's own
    `secret_index` table (name → path/key); read-through value cache with a
    capped TTL (rotated values re-read). `list()` returns metadata only,
    never values. Minimal typed HTTP client (no extra dependency), injectable
    fetch for testing.
  - Backend selection: the active backend is persisted via `ConfigService`
    and switchable in Settings → Secrets; switching re-routes resolution.
    New `setBackendConfig` / `testBackend` RPCs (manage-gated, status-only)
    and `getBackendConfig` now returns Vault connection metadata
    (`hasCredential`, never the credential). `SecretBackend` gains optional
    `test` / `configure` / `getConfigMeta`.
  - The Vault auth credential is stored as an `x-secret` config field
    (encrypted at rest with the AES-GCM master key, redacted on read) —
    bootstrapping it WITHOUT putting it in Vault. It is write-only over the
    API and never logged.
  - Admin UI: backend selector + Vault connection form + "Test connection".

  Satellite-direct-Vault (a satellite reading Vault itself) is deferred to a
  follow-up; core-mediated delivery already routes through the Vault backend.

- b995afb: Hide secret write controls when the active backend is read-through.

  When a read-through backend (e.g. Vault) was active, the Secrets admin page still showed the "Add a secret", Rotate, and Delete controls even though the backend correctly rejects writes (`set` / `delete` are intentionally unimplemented), so every attempt errored.

  The active backend now reports a capability flag and the UI gates its write affordances on it instead of any hardcoded backend id, so other read-through backends are handled the same way.

  Changes:

  - `@checkstack/secrets-common`: add a `writable: boolean` field to `BackendConfigDto` (returned by `getBackendConfig`). It carries no sensitive data - a capability boolean only.
  - `@checkstack/secrets-backend`: populate `writable` in the `getBackendConfig` handler by inspecting the resolved active backend (true only when it implements both `set` and `delete`; `false` for read-through backends or an unresolved active id). Exposes a small `isBackendWritable` helper.
  - `@checkstack/secrets-frontend`: hide the create form, per-row Rotate / Delete buttons, and adjust the empty-state and helper text when the active backend is not writable, plus show a short "read-through" explainer. The local backend stays fully writable.

  State & scale: `writable` is derived on read from the resolved active backend's capabilities (durable config selects the backend), so every pod computes the same answer; no new state is introduced.

### Patch Changes

- b995afb: Tidy the user menu: move "Script packages" and "Secrets" into the **Configuration** group (the now-empty **Administration** group is gone), and display the user-menu groups in alphabetical order instead of a hardcoded canonical order.
