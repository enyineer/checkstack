### Patch Changes

- b33fb4d: Refresh `bun.lock` to clear MEDIUM-severity Trivy advisories on transitive
  runtime dependencies. No public API change — bumping every workspace
  package that lists `@orpc/server` as a direct dep so consumers re-resolve
  the optional `ws` peer to the patched release on their next install.

  - `ws` `8.20.0` → `8.20.1` (CVE-2026-45736). Pulled into the install tree
    as `@orpc/server`'s optional WebSocket peer; Bun auto-installs it into
    every backend package that depends on `@orpc/server`, so a stale 8.20.0
    ships in the consumer's `node_modules` until the parent package
    re-resolves.
  - `brace-expansion` `5.0.5` → `5.0.6` (CVE-2026-45149). Pulled in only
    through dev tooling (`minimatch@10` via `@typescript-eslint` and
    `storybook`'s `glob@13`), so it does not ship to consumers and no
    workspace `package.json` lists it; the lockfile bump alone clears the
    finding for the Docker image and the local dev tree. No version bump
    is attributed to this advisory.

  The fix lives entirely in `bun.lock` — no `package.json`, `overrides`, or
  `resolutions` change is needed because both parent ranges (`minimatch@10
→ brace-expansion@^5.0.5`, `@orpc/server / storybook / happy-dom →
ws@>=8.18.x`) already accept the patched releases, and `bun install`
  keeps the resolved versions sticky after the initial `bun update`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3547670: Add `@checkstack/tips-*` — first-run tip and onboarding infrastructure for
  the frontends.

  Three new packages:

  - `@checkstack/tips-common` — RPC contract (`tipsContract`), `TipsApi`
    client definition, and zod schemas. Fully-qualified tip IDs have shape
    `<pluginId>.<localTipId>` and are produced exclusively by
    `qualifyTipId(plugin, localId)` — plugins never write the namespace
    themselves, and a local id with a leading or trailing `.` is rejected,
    so one plugin cannot forge or dismiss a tip in another plugin's
    namespace.
  - `@checkstack/tips-backend` — Postgres-backed dismissal store
    (`user_tip_dismissal` with composite PK on `(user_id, tip_id)`),
    `listDismissed` / `dismiss` / `reset` endpoints scoped to the
    requesting user via the auto-auth middleware, and a
    `auth.userDeleted` hook that cleans up dismissals when a user is
    deleted.
  - `@checkstack/tips-frontend` — `<Tip>` (anchored popover) and
    `<TipBanner>` (inline callout) components plus the `useTipState`
    hook. All three accept `{ plugin, id }` (where `plugin` is the
    caller's `pluginMetadata`) and route through `qualifyTipId` so the
    namespace prefix is enforced at the boundary. Persists per-user on
    the server when logged in, and per-browser in `localStorage`
    (`checkstack.tips.dismissed`) when anonymous, with cross-tab sync via
    the `storage` event.

  `@checkstack/ui`'s `<EmptyState>` gains optional `steps` and `actions`
  props for richer empty-state coaching (numbered onboarding lists +
  primary CTA), and accepts `ReactNode` for `description`. Existing
  callers continue to work unchanged.

  `@checkstack/test-utils-backend`'s `createMockDb` now also mocks
  `insert().values().onConflictDoNothing()` so routers using upsert-or-skip
  semantics can be unit-tested.
