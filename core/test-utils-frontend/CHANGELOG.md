### Patch Changes

- 2e20792: Declare `sideEffects` (CSS-only) so bundlers can tree-shake these packages' barrel exports

  These packages now declare `"sideEffects": ["**/*.css"]` in their
  `package.json`. This lets a consuming bundle drop unused barrel re-exports
  instead of pulling a whole package's component graph when only one
  provider/hook is imported (e.g. importing `SessionProvider` no longer dragged an
  admin form). It is build metadata only - no runtime behavior change.

### Patch Changes

- fb705df: Upgrade React 18 to React 19 across the platform.

  **BREAKING (runtime frontend plugins):** React is shared as a Module Federation
  singleton, so the host now provides **React 19** to every runtime plugin.
  Frontend plugins built against React 18 must be rebuilt against React 19
  (`react` / `react-dom` `^19`). The scaffold templates and the host/plugin MF
  `requiredVersion` are updated to `^19`. `react` (and now `react-dom`) are pinned
  to a single version across the workspace via syncpack so the singleton can never
  skew (react and react-dom must match exactly).

  The React 19 removed-API surface was audited - the codebase used only no-arg
  `useRef()` (now `useRef<T | undefined>(undefined)`); no `ReactDOM.render`,
  legacy context, string refs, or function-component `defaultProps`. This also
  clears the `IMPORT_IS_UNDEFINED` build warnings for `React.use` /
  `React.useOptimistic` (react-router 7 feature-detection), which React 19 exports.

  The downstream `*-frontend` packages (and `@checkstack/infrastructure-common`)
  receive only the mechanical `react` dependency bump (`patch`); the framework
  packages carrying the shared-singleton change are bumped `minor`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9dcc848: Align workspace dependency versions and migrate React Router to v7.

  BREAKING CHANGES (React Router v7): All frontend packages now depend on `react-router-dom@^7.16.0`. Previously the workspace declared four divergent ranges (`^6.20.0`, `^6.22.0`, `^7.1.1`, `^7.14.2`), which resolved both `react-router@6` and `react-router@7` into a single bundle. Everything is now unified on v7. The public imports the app uses (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`, `MemoryRouter`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no source rewrites were required - but any out-of-tree plugin still on react-router v6 should upgrade to v7 (see the React Router v6 -> v7 upgrade guide) to share the host's single router instance via the import map.

  Other unified ranges (no API change): `react` -> `^18.3.1`, the `@orpc/*` family (`contract`, `server`, `client`, `tanstack-query`, `openapi`, `zod`) -> `^1.14.4`, and `better-auth` -> `^1.6.13`.

  Removed the pre-rename `@orpc/react-query` leftover from `@checkstack/frontend-api`; its `createRouterUtils` / `RouterUtils` / `ProcedureUtils` now come from `@orpc/tanstack-query` (the package already in use).

  Stale in-range runtime deps pulled up to current published versions: `hono` `^4.12.23`, `@tanstack/react-query` (+devtools) `^5.100.14`, `date-fns` `^4.4.0`, `jose` `^6.2.3`, `tar` `^7.5.16`, `semver` `^7.8.1`, `@xyflow/react` `^12.11.0`.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 50e5f5f: Runtime plugin system: install + uninstall plugins from npm, GitHub releases
  (including private GitHub Enterprise instances), or tarball uploads at
  runtime, with multi-package bundles, dependency-derived compatibility checks,
  multi-instance coordination via a Postgres artifact store, and
  single-coordinator destructive cleanup.

  Highlights:

  - New `PluginSource` discriminated union and `PluginInstaller` /
    `PluginInstallerRegistry` interfaces in `@checkstack/backend-api`. The
    GitHub variant accepts an optional `apiBaseUrl` so deployments backed by
    GitHub Enterprise can install from `https://ghe.example.com/api/v3`
    instead of `api.github.com`.
  - New `installPackageMetadataSchema` (Zod) in `@checkstack/common` validates
    every plugin's `package.json` at install time. Required fields: `name`,
    `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `checkstack.type`,
    `checkstack.pluginId`. Optional: `checkstack.bundle`,
    `checkstack.usageInstructions`, `checkstack.allowInstallScripts`.
  - New `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common` with
    `list`, `previewInstall`, `install`, `previewUninstall`, `uninstall`, and
    `events` procedures.
  - New `@checkstack/pluginmanager-frontend` admin UI: installed-plugins list
    with per-row uninstall (typed-confirmation modal, schema/configs/cascade
    toggles), install page with NPM / Tarball Upload / GitHub Release tabs
    (Catalog tab disabled — coming soon), and an events page surfacing the
    install/uninstall audit log.
  - New `bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack` CLI for plugin authors —
    per-package mode produces an npm-shaped tarball; `--bundle` mode produces
    an outer tarball containing every sibling declared in
    `package.json#checkstack.bundle`. Published to npm so external authors
    can `bunx` it directly without a workspace checkout.
  - Compatibility derived from `package.json#dependencies` ranges
    (`semver.satisfies` against the platform's loaded `@checkstack/*`
    versions) — no separate `compatibility` field.
  - Multi-instance: originator persists artifacts + `plugins` rows + broadcasts
    install/uninstall; receiving instances do in-process register/unregister
    only. Destructive ops (drop schema, delete plugin_configs, delete
    artifacts, delete `plugins` rows) run exactly once on the originator.
  - Fresh-instance bootstrap: `loadPlugins()` hydrates any
    `is_uninstallable=true` plugin missing from `node_modules` from the
    artifact store before normal Phase 1 register.
  - New schema: `plugin_artifacts` (tarball storage), `plugin_install_events`
    (audit/error log). `plugins` extended with `version`, `metadata`,
    `source`, `bundle_id`, `is_primary`. Local plugin sync now writes
    `version` from each plugin's `package.json` so the admin UI shows real
    versions instead of `—`.
  - Tarball-upload endpoint (`POST /api/pluginmanager/upload-tarball`) for
    the install UI; access-gated by `pluginmanager.plugin.manage`.
  - Plugin Manager menu link added to the user menu (main grid, alongside
    Profile / Notification Settings / etc.).

  Cross-cutting changes:

  - Backend request/response logging now flows through `rootLogger` (winston)
    instead of `hono/logger`. 5xx responses include the response body inline
    so swallowed early-return errors are visible in the log.
  - The `/api/:pluginId/*` dispatcher now logs which core service is missing
    or which `pluginId` had no metadata when it 500s.
  - New `registerCorePluginMetadata` on `PluginManager` for core routers
    (like the plugin manager itself) that need their metadata visible to the
    RPC dispatcher without going through the full plugin lifecycle.
  - ESLint: `unicorn/no-null` is now disabled globally. Drizzle distinguishes
    between `null` (writes a real SQL NULL) and `undefined` (skip the column
    on insert), so treating them as interchangeable produced latent bugs at
    the persistence boundary. The bulk of the patch-bumped packages above
    reflect lint-fix touches that landed when this rule was relaxed.
  - Workspace-wide license normalization to `Elastic-2.0` (matches
    `LICENSE.md`). Every `package.json` in the workspace now declares the
    same SPDX identifier; the patch bumps capture this.

  Plugin packages (every `plugins/*`): added a `pack` npm script
  (`bunx @checkstack/scripts plugin-pack`), mirrored each plugin's
  `pluginId` from `plugin-metadata.ts` into `package.json#checkstack.pluginId`
  so install-time validation passes, stubbed any missing required metadata
  fields (`description`, `author`, `license`), and added
  `checkstack.bundle` to multi-package plugin primaries (telegram, rcon, ssh,
  jira, queue-bullmq, queue-memory, cache-memory).

  Breaking changes:

  - The legacy single-method `PluginInstaller` interface (`install(packageName)`)
    is removed. Callers must use `coreServices.pluginInstallerRegistry`.
  - The old `pluginAdminContract` and `createPluginAdminRouter` are removed.
    Replaced by `pluginManagerContract` in `@checkstack/pluginmanager-common`
    and `createPluginManagerRouter` in `core/backend`.
  - `@checkstack/test-utils-backend` no longer exports
    `createMockPluginInstaller` / `MockPluginInstaller` (the legacy interface
    it shimmed is gone).

  Note: bumps are limited to `minor` (for packages with new public API
  surface) and `patch` (for downstream consumers, license normalization,
  and lint fixes). No `major` bumps despite the `PluginInstaller` removal —
  the legacy interface had no third-party consumers in the wild before this
  runtime plugin system landed, and the contract surface is the same shape
  modulo the rename.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 67158e2: Standardize package metadata, unify AJV versions to 8.18.0, and enforce monorepo architecture rules via updated ESLint configuration. This ensures consistent package discovery and runtime dependency safety across the platform.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 0b9fc58: Fix workspace:\* protocol resolution in published packages

  Published packages now correctly have resolved dependency versions instead of `workspace:*` references. This is achieved by using `bun publish` which properly resolves workspace protocol references.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- d20d274: Initial release of all @checkstack packages. Rebranded from Checkmate to Checkstack with new npm organization @checkstack and domain checkstack.dev.
