Autocomplete the import specifier itself in script editors.

Lazy type acquisition only loads a package's types once its name is already in the buffer, so while you were still typing the import specifier (`import {} from "lod"`) there were no suggestions - the lazy-ATA catch-22. Script editors now suggest installed package names directly in import-specifier position; selecting one (e.g. `lodash`) inserts the name, and the existing ATA loop then loads its `@types/lodash` closure so members complete.

- `@checkstack/ui`: `CodeEditor`/`TypefoxEditor` gained an injected `importablePackages?: string[]` prop and a dedicated Monaco completion provider (registered once per `typescript`/`javascript` language, scoped to the editor's model, disposed on unmount). It fires ONLY when the cursor is inside an import/require module-specifier string - detected by a new pure, unit-tested helper `importSpecifierCompletionContext(lineUpToCursor)` that handles `from "…"`, bare `import "…"`, `require("…")`, and dynamic `import("…")`, returns the partial specifier + the replace range, and returns null once the string is closed or outside an import. Items are `kind: Module`, insert the bare name without touching the quotes, and coexist with (do not replace) the TS worker's own completions. Trigger characters: `"`, `'`, and `/` (for scoped subpaths); manual invoke (Ctrl+Space) also works. A new pure helper `importablePackageNames` filters a raw manifest name list (excludes `@types/*`, dedupes, sorts).
- `@checkstack/script-packages-frontend`: `useScriptPackageTypeAcquisition()` now also returns `importablePackages`, derived from the installed manifest (what is actually resolvable at runtime) with `@types/*` companions excluded - you import `lodash`, never `@types/lodash` (the `@types` package still backs the closure types).
- `@checkstack/automation-frontend` / `@checkstack/healthcheck-frontend`: pass `importablePackages` into `DynamicForm` alongside the existing `acquireTypes` wiring, so both the Run Script action editor and healthcheck collector editors get import-name completion.

The completion list is plugin-agnostic in `@checkstack/ui` (the names are injected); it never fires outside import-string positions, so normal completions are unaffected.
