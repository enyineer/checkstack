Input-validation and error-mapping hardening found by a fuzzing pass against the built container.

- backend: a Postgres driver error caused by bad client input no longer surfaces as a `500`. The `/api` and `/rest` dispatchers now map the relevant SQLSTATE classes to the correct status - `22P02`/`22003`/`22001`/`22007` (malformed/out-of-range/over-long/bad-date value), `23502`/`23503`/`23514` (missing/dangling/check-failed) to `400`, and `23505` (unique violation) to `409` - and log them at `warn` (client mistake), not `error`. The client-facing message is generic so column/constraint names are never leaked; genuine unknown faults still log at `error` and 500. Previously a `where id = $1` with a non-uuid `$1` (or an over-long string, or a foreign-key miss in `addSystemToGroup`) reached the driver and 500'd, making routine probing look like a server outage and burying real 500s.
- slo-common: **fixes a stored cluster-wide DoS.** `windowDays` was accepted up to `2^53`, but the SLO engine derives window boundaries with `Date(now - windowDays * 86_400_000)` - a large value overflows past the max representable `Date` and yields `Invalid Date`. That objective committed fine, then every subsequent read of the system's objectives threw `RangeError: Invalid time value` during serialization (a 500 readable by anyone with SLO read access, on any pod). `windowDays` is now bounded to 1..3650 days at the contract, the GitOps `kind: SLO` spec, and the update path via a single shared `SloWindowDaysSchema`, so the poison row can never be created.
- slo-common + healthcheck-common: SLO `getDailySnapshots` and the healthcheck history endpoints (`getHistory`, `getDetailedHistory`, `getAggregatedHistory`, `getDetailedAggregatedHistory`, `getRunsForAnalysis`) declared their `startDate`/`endDate` params as `z.date()`, which a `/rest/...` string param can never satisfy - so those endpoints 400'd on the entire REST surface. They now use `z.coerce.date()`, accepting both the REST string shape and the native RPC `Date`.
- healthcheck-common: `intervalSeconds` was `z.number().min(1)` with no `.int()` and no upper bound, so a fractional or out-of-range value reached the DB and failed at insert (the column is a 32-bit int). It is now `.int().min(1).max(2_592_000)` (1 second .. 30 days), applied to both create and update (the update schema is the create partial).
- catalog-common: system/group/environment names were bare `z.string()` (environment was `.min(1)` only), so empty, whitespace-only, and 100KB+ names reached the DB - the huge ones surfaced as 500s when parameter binding blew up. Names are now `trim().min(1).max(200)` via a shared schema.

  **BREAKING:** `getSystemContacts` is now `userType: "authenticated"` (was `"public"`). System contacts carry PII (user id, name, email); the public read leaked them to anonymous status-page visitors. Anonymous callers now receive `401` for this one endpoint; the system detail page already renders "No contacts assigned" for anonymous viewers, so the UI degrades gracefully. All other catalog reads remain public.
- catalog-frontend: the system detail page skips the `getSystemContacts` request entirely for anonymous viewers (it would now `401`) and falls back to the empty state.

This is a beta release: the breaking contact-visibility change ships as a minor bump per the beta versioning policy, not a major.
