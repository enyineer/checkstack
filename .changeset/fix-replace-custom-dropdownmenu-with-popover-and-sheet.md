Fix several modal/sheet/overlay closing issues:

- Replace the custom `DropdownMenu` container with a Radix-based `Popover` (desktop) and `Sheet` (mobile). The previous mobile implementation suppressed outside-click closing, leaving the notification bell's panel only closable by clicking the bell again. `UserMenu` and `NotificationBell` were updated to the new pattern. Leaf primitives `DropdownMenuItem`, `DropdownMenuLabel`, and `DropdownMenuSeparator` are preserved (now backed by a `MenuCloseContext`) so existing call sites continue to work.
- Fix `Dialog` outside-click closing. The previous structure made `DialogPrimitive.Content` cover the full viewport, so Radix never registered clicks on the dimmed area as "outside" — only ESC could close the modal. The centering wrapper is now a non-Content `<div>` and the actual modal box is the Content, so outside-click closes correctly. A visible X button is now rendered by default; pass `hideCloseButton` to suppress it (e.g. for the search overlay where it would clash with a custom header).
- Export a standalone `useIsMobile` hook and a new `Popover` primitive.
- Prevent Radix's auto-focus-return on `NotificationBell` and `UserMenu` overlays. Closing via an item with a `<Link>` (e.g. "View all notifications") would synchronously refocus the trigger via `onCloseAutoFocus`, stealing focus from the link mid-click on pages where another element held focus and requiring a second click to navigate.
