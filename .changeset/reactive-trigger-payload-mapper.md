Restore the documented domain payload fields on entity-driven automation triggers.

Migrated triggers declare domain-named `payloadSchema`s (incident `incidentId`; health `systemId` / `previousStatus`; catalog `systemId` / `changedFields`; dependency `dependencyId`), but Stage-2 dispatch built `trigger.payload` from the generic entity-change shape (`{ kind, id, prev, next, delta, ...next }`). Operator filters and templates reading `trigger.payload.incidentId` / `.systemId` / `.previousStatus` silently resolved to `undefined` — a regression vs the legacy hook payloads.

Changes:

- `@checkstack/automation-backend`: `registerChangeDeriver` now accepts an optional per-kind `toPayload(changed) => Record<string, unknown>` mapper (at most one per kind; a second distinct mapper throws). Stage-2's `changedToPayload` uses the registered mapper to build `trigger.payload` so it matches the kind's declared `payloadSchema`, falling back to the generic change shape for kinds without a mapper. New exported type `EntityChangePayloadMapper`.
- `@checkstack/incident-backend`, `@checkstack/healthcheck-backend`, `@checkstack/catalog-backend`, `@checkstack/dependency-backend`: implement and register a `toPayload` for each entity-driven kind so `trigger.payload` carries the legacy domain keys again.

Descriptive incident payload fields not derivable from the reactive entity state (`title`, `description`, `createdAt`, `resolvedAt`) are now OPTIONAL on the incident trigger `payloadSchema`s — they were always absent from an entity-driven payload.
