Automations now run as a configured service account, removing implicit god-mode from the dispatch path.

BREAKING: every automation must declare a `runAs` application (service account). Previously every automation action ran as the trusted service client, bypassing all access-rule, per-resource, and team-scope checks - so an automation could touch any team's data. Now each automation runs as a bounded `application` principal, and every data-access call an action makes is authorized exactly as that identity. An automation with no `runAs` fails to run with a clear error rather than falling back to the trusted client; legacy automations must be assigned a service account before they run again.

What changed:

- New top-level field `runAs` on automations (a `run_as_application_id` column + create/update inputs; `AutomationSchema.runAs`). Required on create; GitOps sets it via the `run-as` metadata label.
- A new `coreServices.rpcClientAs(applicationId)` mints a short-lived, backend-signed app-principal token; the auth service resolves it LIVE to an `application` principal (reusing `enrichApplicationPrincipal`), so it flows through full `autoAuthMiddleware` enforcement. The dispatch engine threads this client into every action's `execute` as the required `context.rpcClient`.
- Bind authority (anti-escalation): a user may only bind an application whose access rules are a subset of their own (`isApplicationBindable`); `getBindableApplications` lists only bindable apps, and the create/update handlers enforce the check.
- `notification.sendTransactional` moves from service-only to access-gated (`notification.send`, a new access rule), so an automation's `runAs` can call the built-in `notify_user` / `notification.send` actions; trusted services still bypass via short-circuit.
- A "Run as (Service Account)" picker in the automation editor, populated from `getBindableApplications` (server-side filtered to bindable apps), seeding from the loaded `runAs` on edit and passing it into create + update. First-class teaching UX: an inline info banner, a blocked Save with an inline hint until one is chosen, and an empty state linking to the Applications admin + docs when none are bindable.

State and scale: `runAs` resolution is a pure read over shared tables; the app-principal token is self-contained and verified statelessly, so the per-run client is correct under horizontal scale.

This is a beta minor.
