Health-check strategy and collector configs now migrate-then-validate when loaded, instead of being cast/rendered raw.

These configs declared `version: 2`/`3` migrations but the load path never ran them: stored values are persisted UNVERSIONED, and the executor cast them straight to the strategy/collector type. Both the execution path (`queue-executor`) and the read API (`mapConfig`, feeding router / frontend / gitops `getConfiguration`) now use assume-v1-on-read (`Versioned.parseAssumingV1`): wrap as version 1, run the declared chain, then validate. Order is preserved: migrate -> secret resolve -> template render -> execute. An unregistered strategy/collector or a failed migrate falls back to the raw stored blob rather than dropping the configuration. Every reshaper migration is now IDEMPOTENT, guarding on its legacy discriminator so already-current data passes through untouched.

BREAKING CHANGE: for any config GENUINELY at version 1 in the database (e.g. an HTTP strategy still carrying `url`/`method`, or an execute collector still carrying `command`/`args`), the declared migrations now actually RUN on load, so the loaded/returned shape changes for such rows. This is the intended fix - those fields were already supposed to have been migrated away. Configs already at the current shape are unaffected. No data backfill is performed; migration is applied on every read.

This is a beta minor.
