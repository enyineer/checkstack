Fix dependency map node positions resetting when connecting two nodes. The graph-building effect was rebuilding all nodes from scratch on every data change, discarding unsaved drag positions. Node and edge construction are now split into separate effects with a clear position resolution priority: in-memory positions → saved positions → auto-layout fallback for new systems only.
