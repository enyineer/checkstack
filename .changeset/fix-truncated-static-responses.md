Fix truncated static file responses in production container

Hono's `c.body()` wasn't fully consuming Bun's `ReadableStream` from `file.stream()`, causing truncated responses (e.g. 129B instead of 1098B for the favicon). Switched to reading the file as `ArrayBuffer` before passing to `c.body()`, ensuring the full content is delivered.
