Plugin-owned AI tools: every domain plugin contributes its own AI tools (chat assistant + automation AI action), and `ai-backend` is platform-only.

Every plugin-specific AI tool is owned by the plugin whose domain it acts on, registered via that plugin's own `aiToolExtensionPoint` / `aiToolProjectionExtensionPoint` from its init - the same path an external plugin author uses. `ai-backend` no longer imports or depends on any capability plugin's `*-common`; the dependency direction is strictly plugin -> ai-platform. Pure helpers (`computeFieldDiff`, capability-summary, `ScriptContextKind`) live in `@checkstack/ai-common`.

Tools shipped:

- Health checks and automations: full CRUD - `healthcheck.propose` / `automation.propose` and `*.update` (`mutate`, deep-validated) and `*.delete` (`destructive`, always confirm-gated). `healthcheck.propose`'s dry-run calls the new deep `validateConfiguration` so propose-time validation matches apply-time. Assertions are validated against the collector's result schema and the canonical operator vocabulary. Capability-catalog tools (`ai.listCapabilities`, `ai.getCapabilitySchema`), script context tools (`ai.getScriptContext`, `ai.testScript`), and notify-subscriber tools (`healthcheck.notifySystemSubscribers` / `...GroupSubscribers`).
- Catalog: `catalog.createSystem` / `updateSystem` / `createGroup` / `updateGroup` (`mutate`), `catalog.deleteSystem` / `deleteGroup` (`destructive`), membership tools (`mutate`), plus `catalog.listSystems` / `listGroups` read projections.
- Incident: `incident.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `resolve` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `incident.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `incident.get` / `incident.list` read projections.
- Maintenance: `maintenance.create` / `update` / `addUpdate` / `close` / `addLink` (`mutate`), `maintenance.delete` / `removeLink` (`destructive`), and `maintenance.list` / `get` read projections.
- Read projections for SLO (`slo.listObjectives`), dependency (`dependency.list`), incident (`incident.list`), healthcheck (`healthcheck.status`), and anomaly (`anomaly.explain`), each gated by the source procedure's own access rule and routed as the principal.
- Documentation grounding: `ai.searchDocs` / `ai.getDoc` over a build-time bundled docs index (BM25-ish ranking), so the assistant grounds how-to answers in Checkstack's own docs offline.
- URL introspection: `ai.probeUrl`, an SSRF-guarded read tool the assistant uses to inspect a real endpoint before drafting a health check. Update tools compute a before -> after field diff rendered on the confirm card (approve mode) or an "Applied" card (auto mode), so a change is never silent.

`ai_analyze` automation action (automation-backend, with an editor connection picker + audited tool calls): runs a bounded AI agent on the run context as the automation's `runAs` service account, so it can never exceed that identity's permissions; destructive tools are never offered; mutating tools auto-apply through the service account's client. Produces an `automation.analysis` artifact downstream actions can branch on. The agent loop is exposed as a headless `aiAgentRunnerRef` service so automation-backend can drive it without depending on ai-backend.

`notification.notifyForSubscription` is now callable by user / application principals holding `notification.send` (previously service-only). Every tool routes through the user-scoped client, so handler-side authorization is enforced exactly as a direct UI/RPC action; the resolver gate plus the propose/apply re-check at propose AND apply are the additional authority. A systemic authz regression test asserts every registered tool falls into exactly one safe authorization category.

A new `ai_transport` enum value `automation` records the AI action's tool calls in the `ai_tool_calls` audit log. No new durable state beyond that; each tool is a thin, deterministic wrapper over an existing RPC, so every pod behaves identically.

This is a beta minor.
