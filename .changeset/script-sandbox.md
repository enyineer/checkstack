Layered OS-level script sandbox, secure and fail-closed by default (epic #247).

Script and shell health checks and the `run_shell` / `run_script` automation actions now run inside a layered OS-level sandbox by default. The sandbox lives in `core/backend-api/src/script-sandbox/` (the single source of truth) and is enforced inside the shared runners, so it applies wherever a job runs.

Layers:

- Resource caps (CPU / memory / PID / FD / file-size, via `prlimit` on capable Linux; ESM JS-heap cap via `--max-old-space-size`; portable wall-clock timeout) and an OOM-safe streaming output cap.
- Privilege drop via a NON-ROOT supervisor model: the shipped images run the supervisor as non-root uid `65532`, so every sandboxed script inherits non-root and can never be host-root; filesystem + network confinement is delivered by ROOTLESS `bwrap`/`nsjail` via unprivileged user namespaces. `enforced.privilege` is truthful (true only when the child cannot run as host-root). Runners no longer pass `uid`/`gid` to `Bun.spawn` (a silent no-op and a forward-compat hazard).
- Filesystem isolation (`scratch-only` / `scratch-plus-ro`) confining the child to its per-run scratch dir over a read-only base; the interpreter path is RO-bound so the runtime execs, and `TMPDIR` is pinned to the in-namespace tmpfs.
- Network egress control: `deny` (routeless loopback-only netns), `allowlist` (real plumbed egress via macvlan OR rootless slirp4netns + an in-kernel nftables filter), and an always-on metadata / link-local block (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`, `fc00::/7`). No-blackhole invariant: `enforced.network` is never true when egress is actually severed or unfiltered; unpluggable egress degrades to surfaced host net.
- Per-run fork-bomb containment via RLIMIT_NPROC inside the fresh per-run user+PID namespace; a centralized forbidden-env denylist (`LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_*`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `BUN_*`, caller `PATH` overrides).
- A validated tuned seccomp profile (`deploy/seccomp/checkstack-userns.json`) and a live `clone(CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWNET)` capability probe (not the static sysctl), shipped by default in both Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, and `deploy/k8s/checkstack-sandbox.yaml`.

Global policy and operator surface:

- The global sandbox policy lives in ONE durable row owned by `script-packages` (its `ConfigService` row in shared `plugin_configs`). A single process-wide provider serves every runner; the two script plugins no longer register competing providers. A dedicated admin-only `script-sandbox.manage` permission gates both reading and writing the policy. New `getSandboxPolicy` / `setSandboxPolicy` endpoints and a Settings -> Script Sandbox admin UI (`enabled`, `onUnavailable`, network/filesystem/privilege modes, allow list, metadata block, resource caps). The startup capability/readiness log is emitted in-process by `script-packages-backend` (no fragile init-order RPC self-loop), and on a host that cannot enforce a layer a one-time startup warning explains the two local-dev paths (Docker, or set the global policy to `degrade`).
- Satellite relay: the WS protocol carries the resolved policy in the `authenticated` message and a `sandbox_policy` push-on-change; a satellite caches the last relayed policy and resolves every run through it.

BREAKING CHANGES (platform in BETA, shipped as minor):

- Scripts run sandboxed by default. The shipped global default is FAIL-CLOSED (`onUnavailable: "fail"`): when a requested layer cannot be enforced the run is REFUSED (clean `exitCode: -1`, never an unsandboxed spawn) rather than silently degrading. Deployments on hosts that cannot enforce a layer (no bubblewrap, user namespaces blocked, no `/proc` unmask) must run the official images with the documented runtime flags (the bundled seccomp profile + `systempaths=unconfined`, or k8s `procMount: Unmasked`), or set the global policy to `degrade`. On macOS / restricted containers the strong layers degrade to the portable subset and are surfaced per run.
- Default network posture is deny-egress (`allowlist` with an empty allow list, which resolves to the routeless `deny` path). Scripts calling external endpoints fail until those destinations are allowlisted in the global default. The always-on metadata / link-local block applies even under looser modes.
- The per-action / per-check `sandbox` config override and the transport `ScriptRequest.sandbox` field are removed; policy is global-only, so an automation/check author can no longer weaken the sandbox on their own item. Stored configs carrying a stray `sandbox` key are tolerated (stripped on parse).
- The shared runners' `run()` no longer accepts a `sandbox` option; callers rely on the global policy provider.
- A satellite fails closed (most restrictive profile) until it receives the first relayed policy; a relay-read failure or an older core keeps it fail-closed. A relay failure can never loosen a satellite's sandbox.

State and scale: the global policy is a single durable Postgres row read identically on every pod. Capability detection is per-process, deterministic from the host kernel, and surfaced per run via the `EffectiveSandbox` report (a Linux pod and a macOS satellite may legitimately differ). `CHECKSTACK_SANDBOX_UID/GID` and macvlan addressing are genuinely per-host infrastructure, surfaced per run, not the queryable policy. The satellite's policy cache is satellite-local transport state. No new pod-local current-state.

This is a beta minor.
