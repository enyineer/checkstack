Fix static file Content-Length header stripped by Hono middleware

Hono's CORS middleware wraps raw `Response` objects and strips Bun's auto-generated headers. Switched to using `c.body()` + `c.header()` so Content-Type and Content-Length survive the middleware pipeline. Extracted a shared `serveFile` helper for all static file routes.
